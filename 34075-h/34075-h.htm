<h3>KEY TO PRONUNCIATION</h3>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

  <p>The method of marking pronunciations here employed is either (1) by
  marking the syllable on which the accent falls, or (2) by a simple system
  of transliteration, to which the following is the Key:&mdash;</p>

<h3>VOWELS</h3>

  <p>&#x101;, as in f<i>a</i>te, or in b<i>a</i>re.</p>

  <p>ä, as in <i>a</i>lms, Fr. <i>â</i>me, Ger. B<i>a</i>hn = á of Indian
  names.</p>

  <p>a<span class="x1"><span class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>, the same
  sound short or medium, as in Fr. b<i>a</i>l, Ger. M<i>a</i>nn.</p>

  <p>a, as in f<i>a</i>t.</p>

  <p>a<span class="x1"><span class="x3">&#xA8;</span></span>, as in
  f<i>a</i>ll.</p>

  <p><i>a</i>, obscure, as in rur<i>a</i>l, similar to <i>u</i> in
  b<i>u</i>t, &#x117; in h<i>e</i>r: common in Indian names.</p>

  <p>&#x113;, as in m<i>e</i> = <i>i</i> in mach<i>i</i>ne.</p>

  <p>e, as in m<i>e</i>t.</p>

  <p>&#x117;, as in h<i>e</i>r.</p>

  <p>&#x12B;, as in p<i>i</i>ne, or as <i>ei</i> in Ger. m<i>ei</i>n.</p>

  <p>i, as in p<i>i</i>n, also used for the short sound corresponding to
  &#x113;, as in French and Italian words.</p>

  <p><i>eu</i>, a long sound as in Fr. j<i>eû</i>ne = Ger. long <i>ö</i>,
  as in S<i>ö</i>hne, G<i>ö</i>the (Goethe).</p>

  <p>eu, corresponding sound short or medium, as in Fr. p<i>eu</i> = Ger.
  <i>ö</i> short.</p>

  <p>&#x14D;, as in n<i>o</i>te, m<i>oa</i>n.</p>

  <p>o, as in n<i>o</i>t, s<i>o</i>ft&mdash;that is, short or medium.</p>

  <p>ö, as in m<i>o</i>ve, tw<i>o</i>.</p>

  <p>&#x16B; as in t<i>u</i>be.</p>

  <p>u, as in t<i>u</i>b: similar to &#x117; and also to <i>a</i>.</p>

  <p>u<span class="x1"><span class="x3">&#xA8;</span></span>, as in
  b<i>u</i>ll.</p>

  <p>ü, as in Sc. ab<i>u</i>ne = Fr. <i>û</i> as in d<i>û</i>, Ger.
  <i>ü</i> long as in gr<i>ü</i>n, B<i>ü</i>hne.</p>

  <p>u<span class="x1"><span class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>, the
  corresponding short or medium sound, as in Fr. b<i>u</i>t, Ger.
  M<i>ü</i>ller.</p>

  <p>oi, as in <i>oi</i>l.</p>

  <p>ou, as in p<i>ou</i>nd; or as <i>au</i> in Ger. H<i>au</i>s.</p>

<h3>CONSONANTS</h3>

  <p>Of the <i>consonants</i>, <b>b,</b> <b>d,</b> <b>f,</b> <b>h,</b>
  <b>j,</b> <b>k,</b> <b>l,</b> <b>m,</b> <b>n,</b> <b>ng,</b> <b>p,</b>
  <b>sh,</b> <b>t,</b> <b>v,</b> <b>z,</b> always have their common English
  sounds, when used to transliterate foreign words. The letter <b>c</b> is
  not used by itself in re-writing for pronunciation, <b>s</b> or <b>k</b>
  being used instead. The only consonantal symbols, therefore, that require
  explanation are the following:&mdash;</p>

  <p>ch is always as in ri<i>ch</i>.</p>

  <p><i>d</i>, nearly as <i>th</i> in <i>th</i>is = Sp. <i>d</i> in
  Ma<i>d</i>ri<i>d</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>g is always hard, as in <i>g</i>o.</p>

  <p><i>h</i> represents the guttural in Scotch lo<i>ch</i>, Ger.
  na<i>ch</i>, also other similar gutturals.</p>

  <p>n<span class="x1"><span class="x3">&#x2D9;</span></span>, Fr. nasal
  <i>n</i> as in bo<i>n</i>.</p>

  <p>r represents both English <i>r</i>, and <i>r</i> in foreign words,
  which is generally much more strongly trilled.</p>

  <p>s, always as in <i>s</i>o.</p>

  <p>th, as <i>th</i> in <i>th</i>in.</p>

  <p><i>th</i>, as <i>th</i> in <i>th</i>is.</p>

  <p>w always consonantal, as in <i>w</i>e.</p>

  <p>x = ks, which are used instead.</p>

  <p>y always consonantal, as in <i>y</i>ea (Fr. <i>ligne</i> would be
  re-written l&#x113;ny).</p>

  <p>zh, as <i>s</i> in plea<i>s</i>ure = Fr. <i>j</i>.</p>

  Hippodam&#x12B;a, and grandson of Tant&#x103;lus. Atreus was the father
  of Agamemnon, according to Homer; other writers call him Agamemnon's
  grandfather. He succeeded Eurystheus, his father-in-law, as King of
  Myc&#x113;næ, and in revenge for the seduction of his wife by his brother
  Thyestes gave a banquet at which the latter partook of the flesh of his
  own sons. Atreus was killed by Ægisthus, a son of Thyestes. The tragic
  events connected with this family furnished materials to some of the
  great Greek dramatists.</p>

  <p><b>Atri</b> (ancient, <b>Hadria</b>), an episcopal city in the
  province of Teramo, Italy, 8 miles from the Adriatic. It has an old
  (thirteenth century) Gothic cathedral, ruins of ancient Roman walls and
  buildings, and a palace of the Agraviva family, who were Dukes of Atri
  from 1398 to 1775. Pop. 14,043.</p>

  <p><b>At´riplex.</b> See <i>Orache</i>.</p>

  <p><b>A´trium</b>, the entrance-hall and most important apartment of a
  Roman house, generally ornamented with statues, pictures, and
  <i>imagines</i> or ancestral likenesses, which were portrait masks in wax
  kept in cases. The <i>atrium</i> formed the reception-room for visitors
  and clients. It was lighted by the <i>compluvium</i>, an opening in the
  roof, towards which the roof sloped so as to throw the rainwater into a
  cistern in the floor called the <i>impluvium</i>.</p>

  <p>In zoology the term is applied to the large chamber or 'cloaca' into
  which the intestine opens in the Tunicata.</p>

  <p><b>At´ropa</b>, the nightshade genus of plants. See
  <i>Belladonna</i>.</p>

  <p><b>At´rophy</b>, a wasting of the flesh due to some interference with
  the nutritive processes. It may arise from a variety of causes, such as
  permanent, oppressive, and exhausting passions, organic disease, a want
  of proper food or of pure air, suppurations in important organs, copious
  evacuations of blood, saliva, semen, &amp;c., and it is also sometimes
  produced by poisons, for example arsenic, mercury, lead, in miners,
  painters, gilders, &amp;c. In old age the whole frame except the heart
  undergoes atrophic change, and it is of frequent occurrence in infancy as
  a consequence of improper, unwholesome food, exposure to cold, damp, or
  impure air, &amp;c. Single organs or parts of the body may be affected
  irrespective of the general state of nutrition; thus local atrophy may be
  superinduced by palsies, the pressure of tumours upon the nerves of the
  limbs, or by artificial pressure, as in the feet of Chinese ladies.</p>

  <p><b>At´ropin</b>, or <b>At´ropine</b>, a crystalline alkaloid obtained
  from the deadly nightshade (<i>Atr&#x14F;pa Belladonna</i>). It is very
  poisonous, and produces persistent dilation of the pupil.</p>

  <p><b>At´ropos</b>, the eldest of the three Fates (the others being
  Clotho and Lach&#x115;sis), who cuts the thread of life with her
  shears.</p>

  <p><b>Attaché</b> (at´a-sh&#x101;), a junior member of the diplomatic
  services attached to an embassy or legation.</p>

  <p><b>Attach´ment</b>, in English law, a taking of the person, goods, or
  estate by virtue of a writ or precept. It is distinguished from an
  <i>arrest</i> by proceeding out of a higher court by precept or writ,
  whereas the latter proceeds out of an inferior court by precept only. An
  arrest lies only against the body of a man, whereas an attachment lies
  often against the goods only, and sometimes against the body and goods.
  It differs from a <i>distress</i> in that an attachment does not extend
  to lands, while a distress cannot touch the body.&mdash;<i>Foreign
  attachment</i> answers to what in Scotland is termed arrestment, by means
  of which a creditor may obtain the security of the goods or other
  personal property of his debtor in the hands of a third person for the
  purpose of enforcing the appearance of the debtor to answer to an action,
  and afterwards, upon his continued default, of obtaining the property
  absolutely in satisfaction of the demand.</p>

  <p><b>Attack´</b>, the opening act of hostility by a force seeking to
  dislodge an enemy from its position. It is considered more advantageous
  to offer than to await attack, even in a defensive war. The historic
  forms of attack are: (1) the parallel; (2) the form in which both wings
  attack and the centre is kept back; (3) the form in which the centre is
  pushed forward and the wings kept back; (4) the famous oblique mode,
  dating at least from Epaminondas, and employed by Frederick the Great,
  where one wing advances to engage, whilst the other is kept back, and
  occupies the attention of the enemy by pretending an attack. Napoleon
  preferred to mass heavy columns against an enemy's centre. The forms of
  attack have changed with the weapons used. In the days of the pike heavy
  masses were the rule, but the use of the musket led to an extended
  battle-front to give effect to the fire. The advance in long and slender
  lines which grew out of this has been not less famous in the annals of
  British attack than the square formation in those of defence. In the
  European War (1914-18) the Germans often attacked in mass-formation; but
  British attacks were usually carried out by successive <i>waves</i>; one
  wave secured its objective <!-- Page 304 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page304"></a>[304]</span>and consolidated it while another wave
  passed through to attack a more advanced objective. Artillery preparation
  became of increasingly great importance; it broke down the enemy's wire,
  counteracted his artillery-fire, and made his infantry keep under cover.
  In trench-to-trench attacks machine-guns and trench-mortars were of great
  value, and many casualties were avoided by the skilful use of tanks in
  the attack. But it is still a fundamental principle of tactics that the
  infantry is the chief factor in the attack, and that no attack can be
  considered overwhelmingly successful without the use of the bayonet.</p>

  <p><b>Attain´der</b>, the legal consequences of a sentence of death or
  outlawry pronounced against a person for treason or felony, the person
  being said to be <i>attainted</i>. It resulted in forfeiture of estate
  and 'corruption of blood', rendering the party incapable of inheriting
  property or transmitting it to heirs; but these results now no longer
  follow. Formerly persons were often subjected to attainder by a special
  Bill or Act passed in Parliament called <i>Bills of Attainder</i>, the
  last being passed in 1798, in the case of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, one of
  the Irish rebel leaders.</p>

  <p><b>Attaint´</b>, a writ at common law against a jury for a false
  verdict, finally abolished in England in 1825.</p>

  <p><b>Attale´a</b>, a genus of American palms, comprising the piassava
  palm, which produces coquilla-nuts.</p>

  <p><b>Att´alus</b>, the names of three kings of ancient Pergamus (241-133
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), the last of whom bequeathed his kingdom
  to the Romans. They were all patrons of art and literature.</p>

  <p><b>At´tar</b>, in the East Indies, a general term for a perfume from
  flowers; in Europe generally used only of the <i>attar</i> or <i>otto of
  roses</i>, an essential oil made from <i>Rosa centifolia</i>, the
  hundred-leaved or cabbage-rose, <i>R. damasc&#x113;na</i>, or
  damask-rose, <i>R. mosch&#x101;ta</i>, or musk-rose, &amp;c., 100,000
  roses yielding only 180 grains of attar. Cashmere, Shiraz, and Damascus
  are celebrated for its manufacture, and there are extensive rose farms in
  the valley of Kezanlik in Roumelia and at Ghazipur in Benares. The oil is
  at first greenish, but afterwards it presents various tints of green,
  yellow, and red. It is concrete at all ordinary temperatures, but becomes
  liquid about 84° F. It consists of two substances, a hydrocarbon and an
  oxygenated oil, and is frequently adulterated with the oils of rhodium,
  sandal-wood, and geranium, with the addition of camphor or
  spermaceti.</p>

  <p><b>At´terbury</b>, Francis, an English prelate, born in 1662, and
  educated at Westminster and Oxford. In 1687 he took his degree of M.A.,
  and appeared as a controversialist in a defence of the character of
  Luther, entitled, <i>Considerations on the Spirit of Martin Luther</i>,
  &amp;c. He also assisted his pupil, the Hon. Charles Boyle, in his famous
  controversy with Bentley on the <i>Epistles of Phalaris</i>. Having taken
  orders in 1691 he settled in London, became chaplain to William and Mary,
  preacher of Bridewell, and lecturer of St. Bride's. Controversy was
  congenial to him, and in 1706 he commenced one with Dr. Wake, which
  lasted four years, on the rights, privileges, and powers of convocations.
  For this service he received the thanks of the lower house of convocation
  and the degree of Doctor of Divinity from Oxford. Soon after the
  accession of Queen Anne he was made Dean of Carlisle, aided in the
  defence of the famous Sacheverell, and wrote <i>A Representation of the
  Present State of Religion</i>. In 1712 he was made Dean of Christ Church,
  and in 1713 Bishop of Rochester and Dean of Westminster. After the death
  of the queen in 1714 he distinguished himself by his opposition to George
  I; and, having entered into a correspondence with the Pretender's party,
  was apprehended in Aug., 1722, and committed to the Tower. Being banished
  the kingdom, he settled in Paris, where he chiefly occupied himself in
  study and in correspondence with men of letters. But even here, in 1725,
  he was actively engaged in fomenting discontent in the Scottish
  Highlands. He died in 1731, and his body was privately interred in
  Westminster Abbey. His sermons and letters are marked by ease and grace;
  but as a critic and a controversialist he is rather dexterous and popular
  than accurate and profound.</p>

  <p><b>Attercliffe</b>, a parliamentary division of the borough of
  Sheffield.</p>

  <p><b>Attic</b>, an architectural term variously used. An <i>Attic
  base</i> is a peculiar kind of base, used by the ancient architects in
  the Ionic order and by Palladio and some others in the Doric. An <i>Attic
  story</i> is a low story in the upper part of a house rising above the
  main portion of the building. In ordinary language an attic is an
  apartment lighted by a window in the roof.</p>

  <p><b>At´tica</b>, a State of ancient Greece, the capital of which is
  Athens. The territory was triangular in shape, with Cape Sunium (Colonna)
  as its apex and the ranges of Mounts Cithæron and Parnes as its base. On
  the north these ranges separated it from B&oelig;otia; on the west it was
  bounded by Megaris and the Saronic Gulf; on the east by the Ægean. Its
  most marked physical divisions consisted of the highlands, midland
  district, and coast district, with the two famous plains of Eleusis and
  of Athens. The Cephissus and Ilissus, though small, were its chief
  streams; its principal hills, Cithæron, Parnes, Hymettus, Pentelicus, and
  Laurium. Its soil has probably undergone considerable deterioration, but
  produced good fruit, especially <!-- Page 305 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page305"></a>[305]</span>olives and figs. These are still
  cultivated, as well as the vine and cereals, but Attica is better suited
  for pasture than tillage. According to tradition the earliest inhabitants
  of Attica lived in a savage manner until the time of Cecrops, who came,
  1550 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, with a colony from Egypt, taught
  them all the essentials of civilization, and founded Athens. One of
  Cecrops' descendants founded eleven other cities in the regions round,
  and there followed a period of mutual hostility. To Theseus is assigned
  the honour of uniting these cities in a confederacy, with Athens as the
  capital, thus forming the Attic State. After the death of Codrus, 1068
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, the monarchy was abolished, and the
  government vested in archons elected by the nobility, at first for life,
  in 752 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> for ten years, and in 683 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> for one year only. The severe constitution of
  Draco was succeeded in 594 by the milder code of Solon, the democratic
  elements of which, after the brief tyranny of the Pisistratids, were
  emphasized and developed by Clisthenes. He divided the people into ten
  classes, and made the Senate consist of 500 persons, establishing as the
  Government an oligarchy modified by popular control. Then came the
  splendid era of the Persian War, which elevated Athens to the summit of
  fame. Miltiades at Marathon, and Themistocles at Salamis, conquered the
  Persians by land and by sea. The chief external danger being removed, the
  rights of the people were enlarged; the archons and other magistrates
  were chosen from all classes without distinction. The period from the
  Persian War to the time of Alexander (500 to 336 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>) was most remarkable for the development of the
  Athenian constitution. Attica appears to have contained a territory of
  nearly 850 sq. miles, with some 500,000 inhabitants, 360,000 of whom were
  slaves, while the inhabitants of the city numbered 180,000. Cimon and
  Pericles (444 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>) raised Athens to its point
  of greatest splendour, though under the latter began the Peloponnesian
  War, which ended with the conquest of Athens by the Lacedæmonians. The
  succeeding tyranny of the Thirty, under the protection of a Spartan
  garrison, was overthrown by Thrasybulus, with a temporary partial
  restoration of the power of Athens; but the battle of Cheronæa (338 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>) made Attica, in common with the rest of Greece,
  a dependency of Macedon. The attempts at revolt after the death of
  Alexander were crushed, and in 260 B.C. Attica was still under the sway
  of Antigonus Gonatas, the Macedonian king. A period of freedom under the
  shelter of the Achæan League then ensued, but their support of
  Mithridates led, in 146 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, to the
  subjugation of the Grecian States by Rome. After the division of the
  Roman Empire, Attica belonged to the Empire of the East until, in <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 396, it was conquered by Alaric the Goth and the
  country devastated. Attica and B&oelig;otia now form a nome or province
  of the kingdom of Greece, with a population of 407,063.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>At´ticus</b>, Titus Pomponius, a Roman of great wealth and culture,
  born 109 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, and died 32 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> On the death of his father he removed to Athens
  to avoid participation in the civil war, to which his brother Sulpicius
  had fallen a victim. There he so identified himself with Greek life and
  literature as to receive the surname Atticus. It was his principle never
  to mix in politics, and he lived undisturbed amid the strife of factions.
  Sulla and the Marian party, Cæsar and Pompey, Brutus and Antony, were
  alike friendly to him, and he was in favour with Augustus. Of his close
  friendship with Cicero proof is given in the series of letters addressed
  to him by Cicero. He married at the age of fifty-three, and had one
  daughter, Pomponia, named by Cicero Atticula and Attica. He reached the
  age of seventy-seven years without sickness, but, being then attacked by
  an incurable disease, ended his life by voluntary starvation. He was a
  type of the refined Epicurean, and an author of some contemporary repute,
  though none of his works have reached us.&mdash;The name Atticus was
  given to Addison by Pope, in a well-known passage (Prologue to the
  <i>Satires</i>, addressed to Dr. Arbuthnot).</p>

  <p><b>At´tila</b> (in Ger. <i>Etzel</i>), the famous leader of the Huns,
  was the son of Mundzuk, and the successor, in conjunction with his
  brother Bleda, of his uncle Roua. The rule of the two leaders extended
  over a great part of Northern Asia and Europe, and they threatened the
  Eastern Empire, and twice compelled the weak Theodosius II to purchase an
  inglorious peace. Attila caused his brother Bleda to be murdered (444),
  and in a short time extended his dominion over all the peoples of Germany
  and exacted tribute from the Eastern and Western emperors. The Vandals,
  the Ostrogoths, the Gepidæ, and a part of the Franks united under his
  banners, and he speedily formed a pretext for leading them against the
  Empire of the East. He laid waste all the countries from the Black to the
  Adriatic Sea, and in three encounters defeated the Emperor Theodosius,
  but could not take Constantinople. Thrace, Macedonia, and Greece all
  submitted to the invader, who destroyed seventy flourishing cities; and
  Theodosius was obliged to purchase a peace. Turning to the west, the
  'scourge of God', as his defeated enemies termed him, crossed with an
  immense army the Rhine, the Moselle, and the Seine, came to the Loire,
  and laid siege to Orleans. The inhabitants of this city repelled the
  first attack, and the united forces of the Romans under Aetius, and of
  the Visigoths under <!-- Page 306 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page306"></a>[306]</span>their king, Theodoric, compelled Attila to
  raise the siege. He retreated to Champagne, and waited for the enemy in
  the plains of Châlons. In apparent opposition to the prophecies of the
  soothsayers the ranks of the Romans and Goths were broken; but when the
  victory of Attila seemed assured, the Gothic prince Thorismond, the son
  of Theodoric, poured down from the neighbouring height upon the Huns, who
  were defeated with great slaughter. Rather irritated than discouraged, he
  sought in the following year a new opportunity to seize upon Italy, and
  demanded Honoria, the sister of Valentinian III, in marriage, with half
  the kingdom as a dowry. When this demand was refused he conquered and
  destroyed Aquileia, Padua, Vicenza, Verona, and Bergamo, laid waste the
  plains of Lombardy, and was marching on Rome when Pope Leo I went with
  the Roman ambassadors to his camp and succeeded in obtaining a peace.
  Attila went back to Hungary, and died on the night of his marriage with
  Hilda or Ildico (453), either from the bursting of a blood-vessel or by
  her hand. The description that Jordanès (or Jornandes) has left us of him
  is in keeping with his Kalmuck-Tartar origin. He had a large head, a flat
  nose, broad shoulders, and a short and ill-formed body; but his eyes were
  brilliant, his walk stately, and his voice strong and
  well-toned.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: Thierry,

  <p><b>Attor´ney</b>, a person appointed to do something for and in the
  stead and name of another. An attorney may have <i>general</i> powers to
  act for another; or his power may be <i>special</i>, and limited to a
  particular act or acts. A special attorney is appointed by a deed called
  a <i>power</i> or <i>letter of attorney</i>, specifying the acts which he
  is authorized to do. An <i>attorney at law</i> is a person qualified to
  appear for another before a court of law to prosecute or defend any
  action on behalf of his client. The term in England was formerly applied
  especially to those practising before the supreme courts of common law at
  Westminster, and corresponded to the term <i>solicitor</i> used in courts
  of Chancery; but this distinction was abolished in 1873, and
  <i>solicitor</i> is now the regular term for all such legal agents. In
  the United States the term is in common use, and is wide enough to
  include what in England would be called barristers (or counsel), in
  Scotland advocates, having indeed the general sense of lawyer. In America
  women are admitted as attorneys.</p>

  <p><b>Attorney-General</b>, in England and Ireland, the first law-officer
  and legal adviser of the Crown, acting on its behalf in its revenue and
  criminal proceedings, carrying on prosecutions in crimes that have a
  public character, guarding the interests of charitable endowments, and
  granting patents. He is <i>ex officio</i> the leader of the bar, and, as
  a member of Parliament, has charge of all Government measures on legal
  questions. The Solicitor-General holds a similar position, and may act in
  his place. In Scotland the Attorney-General is called Lord-Advocate.
  There are also Attorneys-General in the colonies. In the United States he
  is head of the Department of Justice. The individual States have also an
  Attorney-General.</p>

  <p><b>Attrac´tion</b>, the tendency of all material bodies, whether
  masses or particles, to approach each other, to unite, and to remain
  united. Newton was the first to adopt the theory of a universal
  attractive force, and to determine its laws. When bodies tend to come
  together from sensible distances the tendency is termed either the
  attraction of <i>gravitation</i>, <i>magnetism</i>, or
  <i>electricity</i>, according to circumstances; when the attraction
  operates at insensible distances it is known as <i>adhesion</i> with
  respect to surfaces, as <i>cohesion</i> with respect to the particles of
  a body, and as <i>affinity</i> when the particles of different bodies
  tend together. It is by the attraction of gravitation that all bodies
  fall to the earth when unsupported.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>At´tribute</b>, in philosophy, a quality or property of a
  substance, as whiteness or hardness. A substance is known to us only as a
  congeries of attributes.</p>

  <p>In the fine arts an attribute is a symbol regularly accompanying and
  marking out some personage. Thus the caduceus, purse, winged hat, and
  sandals are attributes of Mercury, the trampled dragon that of St.

  <p><b>Attwood</b>, George, <span class="scac">F.R.S.</span>, an English
  mathematician, born 1746, died 1807, best known by his invention, called
  after him <i>Attwood's Machine</i>, for verifying the laws of falling
  bodies. It consists essentially of a freely-moving pulley over which runs
  a fine cord with two equal weights suspended from the ends. A small
  additional weight is laid upon one of them, causing it to descend with
  uniform acceleration. Means are provided by which the added weight can be
  removed at any point of the descent, thus <!-- Page 307 --><span

  <p><b>Atys</b>, or <b>Attis</b> (at'is), in classical mythology, the
  shepherd lover of Cyb&#x115;le, who, having broken the vow of chastity
  which he made her, castrated himself. In Asia Minor Atys seems to have
  been a deity, with somewhat of the same character as Adonis. Catullus has

  He was originally intended for a mercantile career, but devoted himself
  to music, studying under Cherubini. His first great success was his opera
  <i>La Bergère Châtelaine</i>, produced in 1820. In 1822 he had associated
  himself with Scribe as librettist, and other operas now followed in quick
  succession. Chief among them were <i>Masaniello</i> or <i>La Muette de
  Portici</i> (1828), <i>Fra Diavolo</i> (1830), <i>Lestocq</i> (1834),
  <i>L'Ambassadrice</i> (1836), <i>Le Domino Noir</i> (1837), <i>Les
  Diamants de la Couronne</i> (1841), <i>Marco Spada</i> (1853), <i>La
  Fiancée du Roi de Garbe</i> (1864). Despite his success in
  <i>Masaniello</i>, his peculiar field was comic opera, in which his
  charming melodies, bearing strongly the stamp of the French national

  <p><b>Auction</b> is a public sale to the party offering the best price
  where the buyers bid against each other, or to the bidder who first
  accepts the terms offered by the vendor where he sells by reducing his
  terms until someone accepts them. The latter form is known as a <i>Dutch
  Auction</i>. A sale by auction must be conducted in the most open and
  public manner possible; and there must be no collusion on the part of the
  buyers. Puffing, or mock bidding, to raise the value by apparent
  competition, is illegal.</p>

  <p><b>Auctioneer´</b>, a person who conducts sales by auction. It is his
  duty to state the conditions of sale, to declare the respective biddings,
  and to terminate the sale by <i>knocking down</i> the thing sold to the
  highest bidder. In Britain an auctioneer must have a licence (for which
  he pays £10), renewable annually. Verbal declarations by an auctioneer
  are not suffered to control the printed conditions of sale. The
  Auctioneers' Institute of the United Kingdom was founded in 1886.</p>

  <p><b>Au´cuba</b>, a genus of plants, ord. Cornaceæ, one species of
  which, <i>A. japoníca</i>, a laurel-like shrub with spotted leaves, a
  native of Japan and China, is now common in ornamental grounds in Europe.
  The flowers are di&oelig;cious and inconspicuous. For a long time only
  the female plant, introduced into Britain from Japan in 1783, was
  cultivated, but in 1850 the male was introduced, and the fruit, which
  consists of beautiful coral-red berries, is now frequently developed, and
  adds greatly to the attractiveness of the plant. <i>A. himalaica</i>,
  also brought to Europe, is less hardy.</p>

  <p><b>Aude</b> (&#x14D;d), a maritime department in the S. of France;

  districts are bleak and unproductive; the others tolerably fertile,
  yielding good crops of grain. The wines, especially the white wines, are
  famous; olives and other fruits are also cultivated. The manufactures are
  varied; the trade is facilitated by the Canal du Midi. Carcassonne is the
  capital; other towns are Narbonne and Castelnaudary. Pop. 286,552. The

  <p><b>Au´diphone</b>, an acoustic instrument by means of which deaf
  persons are enabled to hear. It consists essentially of a fan-shaped
  plate of hardened caoutchouc, which is bent to a greater or less degree
  by strings, and is very sensitive to sound-waves. When used, the up edge
  is pressed against the upper front teeth, with the convexity outward, and
  the sounds being collected are conveyed from the teeth to the auditory
  nerve without passing through the external ear.</p>

  <p><b>Au´dit</b>, an examination into accounts or dealings with money or

  studied painting under David. In 1798 he settled in Pennsylvania, but
  having a great love for ornithology he set out in 1810 with his wife and
  child, descended the Ohio, and for many years roamed the forests in every
  direction, drawing the birds which he shot. In 1826 he came to England,
  exhibited his drawings in Liverpool, Manchester, and Edinburgh, and
  finally published them in an unrivalled work of double-folio size, with
  435 coloured plates of birds the size of life (<i>The Birds of
  America</i>, 4 vols., 1827-39), with an accompanying text
  (<i>Ornithological Biography</i>, 5 vols., 8vo, partly written by
  Professor Macgillivray). On his final return to America he laboured with

  pyroxene group of minerals; a constituent of many igneous rocks, such as
  basalt, gabbro, &amp;c. It crystallizes in short almost rectangular <!--
  Page 310 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  planes causing cross-sections to be eight-sided. Its specific gravity is
  about 3.2; lustre vitreous; hardness sufficient to scratch glass; colour
  usually dark. It is a silicate of calcium, magnesium, iron, and
  aluminium, and alters in geological time by slow recrystallization into
  hornblende, possibly with some loss of calcium. It may be imitated by the
  artificial fusion of its constituents. A transparent, green,
  non-aluminous variety found at Zillertal, in Tyrol, is used in

  <p><b>Augsburg</b> (ougz'bu<span class="x1"><span
  class="x3">&#xA8;</span></span>r<i>h</i>; Lat. <i>Augusta
  Vindelicorum</i>), a city of Bavaria, at the junction of the Wertach and
  Lech, antique in appearance, but with some fine streets, squares, and
  handsome or interesting buildings, including a splendid town hall, a
  lofty belfry (Perlach Tower), cathedral, with paintings by Domenichino,
  Holbein, &amp;c.; St. Ulrich's Church; the bishop's palace, where the
  Augsburg Confession was presented to the Diet, afterwards a royal
  residence; the Fugger Palace, or mansion of the celebrated Fugger family;
  the public library; the theatre; the Academy of Arts; and the Fuggerei, a
  separate quarter of the city, consisting of fifty-three small houses,
  tenanted at a merely nominal rent by indigent Roman Catholics. Augsburg
  was a renowned commercial centre in the Middle Ages, and is still an
  important emporium of South German and Italian trade; industries: cotton
  spinning and weaving, dyeing, woollen manufacture, machinery and metal
  goods, books and printing, chemicals, &amp;c. The Emperor Augustus
  established a colony here about 12 B.C. In 1276 it became a free city,
  and, besides being a great mart for the commerce between the north and
  south of Europe, it was a great centre of German art in the Middle Ages.
  It early took a conspicuous part in the Reformation. (See next article.)
  In 1806 it was incorporated in Bavaria. Pop. (1919), 154,555.</p>

  <p><b>Augsburg Confession</b>, a document which was presented by the
  Protestants at the Diet of Augsburg, 1530, to the Emperor Charles V and
  the Diet, and being signed by the Protestant States was adopted as their
  creed. Luther made the original draft; but as its style appeared too
  violent it was given to Melanchthon for amendment. The original is to be
  found in the imperial Austrian archives. Afterwards Melanchthon
  arbitrarily altered some of the articles, and there arose a division
  between those who held the original and those who held the altered
  Augsburg Confession. The former is received by the Lutherans, the latter
  by the German Reformed.</p>

  <p><b>Au´gurs</b>, a board or college of diviners who, amongst the
  Romans, predicted future events and announced the will of the gods from
  the occurrence of certain signs. These consisted of signs in the sky,
  especially thunder and lightning; signs from the flight and cries of
  birds; from the feeding of the sacred chickens; from the course taken or
  sounds uttered by various quadrupeds or by serpents; from accidents or
  occurrences, such as spilling the salt, sneezing, &amp;c. The answers of
  the augurs as well as the signs by which they were governed were called
  <i>auguries</i>, but bird-predictions were properly termed
  <i>auspices</i>. Nothing of consequence could be undertaken without
  consulting the augurs, and by the mere utterance of the words <i>alio
  die</i> ('meet on another day') they could dissolve the assembly of the
  people and annul all decrees passed at the meeting.</p>

  <p><b>Au´gust</b>, the eighth month from January. It was the sixth of the
  Roman year, and hence was called <i>Sext&#x12B;lis</i> till the Emperor
  Augustus affixed to it his own name.</p>

  <p><b>Augus´ta</b>, the name of many ancient places, as Augusta
  Trevirorum, now <i>Trèves</i>; Augusta Taurinorum, now <i>Turin</i>;

  <p><b>Augusta</b>, the capital of Richmond county, Georgia, United
  States, on the left bank of the Savannah River, 231 miles from its mouth;
  well built, and connected with the river by high-level canals; an

  railroad works, &amp;c. Pop. (1920), 52,548.</p>

  <p><b>Au´gustine</b> (Aurelius Augustinus), <b>St.</b>, a renowned father
  of the Christian Church, was born at Tagaste, in Africa, in 354, his
  mother Monica being a Christian, his father Patricius a pagan. His
  parents sent him to Carthage to complete his education, but he
  disappointed their expectations by his neglect of serious study and his
  devotion to pleasure. A lost book of Cicero's, called <i>Hortensius</i>,
  led him to the study of philosophy; but dissatisfied with this he went
  over to the Manichæans. He was one of their disciples for nine years, but
  left them, went to Rome, and thence to Milan, where he announced himself
  as a teacher of rhetoric. St. Ambrose, the bishop of this city, converted
  him to the faith of his boyhood, and the reading of Paul's
  <i>Epistles</i> wrought an entire change in his life and character. He
  retired into solitude, and prepared himself for baptism, which he
  received in his thirty-third year from the hands of Ambrose. Returning to
  <!-- Page 311 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page311"></a>[311]</span>Africa, he sold his estate and gave the
  proceeds to the poor, retaining only enough to support him. At the desire
  of the people of Hippo, Augustine became the assistant of the bishop of
  that town, preached with extraordinary success, and in 395 succeeded to
  the see. He entered into a warm controversy with Pelagius concerning the
  doctrines of free-will, grace, and predestination, and wrote treatises
  concerning them, but of his various works his <i>Confessions</i> is most
  secure of immortality. He died 28th Aug., 430, while Hippo was besieged
  by the Vandals. He was a man of great enthusiasm, self-devotion, zeal for
  truth, and powerful intellect, and though there have been fathers of the
  Church more learned, none have wielded a more powerful influence. His
  doctrine of grace, which was an important contribution to Christian
  thought, triumphed at last in the Reformation and evangelical religion.
  His writings are partly autobiographical, as the <i>Confessions</i>,
  partly polemical, homiletic, or exegetical. The greatest is the <i>City
  of God</i> (<i>De Civitate Dei</i>), a vindication of
  Christianity.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: Joseph McCabe,

  <p><b>Au´gustine</b>, or <b>Austin, St.</b>, the <i>Apostle of the
  English</i>, first Archbishop of Canterbury, flourished at the close of
  the sixth century, was sent, in 596, with forty monks by Pope Gregory I
  to introduce Christianity into Saxon England, and was kindly received by
  Ethelbert, King of Kent, whom he converted, baptising 10,000 of his
  subjects in one day. In acknowledgment of his tact and success Augustine
  received the archiepiscopal pall from the Pope, with instructions to
  establish twelve sees in his province, but he could not persuade the
  British bishops in Wales to unite with the new English Church. He died in
  604 or 605. Cf. Sir H.&nbsp;H. Howorth, <i>St. Augustine of

  <p><b>Au´gustins</b>, or <b>Augustines</b>, members of several monastic
  fraternities who follow rules framed by the great St. Augustine, or
  deduced from his writings, of which the chief are the Canons Regular of
  St. Augustine, or Austin Canons, and the Begging Hermits or Austin
  Friars. The Austin Canons were introduced into Britain about 1100, and
  had about 170 houses in England and about twenty-five in Scotland. They
  took the vows of chastity and poverty, and their habit was a long black
  cassock with a white rochet over it, having over that a black cloak and
  hood. The Austin Friars, originally hermits, were a much more austere
  body, went barefooted, and formed one of the four orders of mendicants.
  An order of nuns had also the name of Augustines. Their garments, at
  first black, were afterwards violet.</p>

  <p><b>Augusto´vo</b>, a town of Poland, formerly in Russia, in the

  <p><b>Augus´tus</b>, Gaius Julius Cæsar Octavianus (originally called
  Gaius Octavius), Roman emperor, was the son of Gaius Octavius and Atia, a
  daughter of Julia, the sister of Julius Cæsar. He was born 63 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, and died <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 14.
  Octavius was at Apollonia, in Epirus, when he received news of the death
  of his uncle (44 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), who had previously
  adopted him as his son. He returned to Rome to claim Cæsar's property and
  avenge his death, and now took, according to usage, his uncle's name with
  the surname Octavianus. He was aiming secretly at the chief power, but at
  first he joined the republican party, and assisted at the defeat of
  Antony at Mutina. He got himself chosen consul in 43. Soon after the
  second triumvirate was formed between him and Antony and Lepidus, and
  this was followed by the conscription and assassination of three hundred
  Senators and two thousand knights of the party opposed to the
  triumvirate. Next year Octavianus and Antony defeated the republican army
  under Brutus and Cassius at Philippi. The victors now divided the Roman
  world between them, Octavianus getting the West, Antony the East, and
  Lepidus Africa. Sextus Pompeius, who had made himself formidable at sea,
  had now to be put down; and Lepidus, who had hitherto retained an
  appearance of power, was deprived of all authority (36 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>) and retired into private life. Antony and
  Octavianus now shared the Empire between them; but while the former, in
  the East, gave himself up to a life of luxury, and alienated the Romans
  by his alliance with Cleopatra and his adoption of Oriental manners,
  Octavianus skilfully cultivated popularity, and soon declared war
  ostensibly against the Queen of Egypt. The naval victory of Actium, in
  which the fleet of Antony and Cleopatra was defeated, made Octavianus
  master of the world, 31 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> He returned to
  Rome, 29 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, celebrated a splendid triumph,
  and caused the temple of Janus to be closed in token of peace being
  restored. Gradually all the highest offices of State, civil and
  religious, were united in his hands, and the new title of Augustus was
  also assumed by him, being formally conferred by the Senate in 27 <span

  exercised it with wise moderation, and kept up the show of a republican

  Dalmatia, &amp;c.; but the defeat of Varus by the Germans under Arminius
  with the loss of three legions, <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 9, was a
  great blow to him in his old age. Many useful decrees proceeded from him,
  and various abuses were abolished. He gave a new form to the Senate,
  employed himself in improving the morals of the people, enacted laws for
  the suppression of luxury, introduced discipline into the armies, and
  order into the games of the circus. He adorned Rome in such a manner that
  it was said: "He found it of brick, and left it of marble". The people
  erected altars to him, and, by a decree of the Senate, the month Sextilis
  was called <i>Augustus</i> (our August). He was a patron of literature;
  Virgil and Horace were befriended by him, and their works and those of
  their contemporaries are the glory of the <i>Augustan Age</i>. His death,
  which took place at Nola, plunged the Empire into the greatest grief. He
  was thrice married, but had no son, and was succeeded by his stepson
  Tiberius, whose mother Livia he had married after prevailing on her
  husband to divorce her.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: J.&nbsp;B.

  <p><b>Augustus II</b> (or <b>Frederick Augustus I</b>), Elector of Saxony
  and King of Poland, second son of John George III, Elector of Saxony, was
  born at Dresden in 1670, died at Warsaw 1733. He succeeded his brother in
  the Electorate in 1694, and the Polish throne having become vacant, in
  1696, by the death of John Sobieski, Augustus presented himself as a
  candidate for it and was successful. He joined with Peter the Great in
  the war against Charles XII of Sweden, invaded Livonia, but was defeated
  by Charles near Riga, and at Clissow, between Warsaw and Cracow. In 1704
  he was deposed, and two years later formally resigned the crown to
  Stanislaus I, now devoting himself to his Saxon dominions. In 1709, after
  the defeat of Charles at Poltava, the Poles recalled Augustus, who united
  himself anew with Peter. The two monarchs, in alliance with Denmark, sent
  troops into Pomerania, but the Swedish general Steinbock defeated the
  allies at Gadebusch, 20th Dec., 1712. The death of Charles XII put an end
  to the war, and Augustus concluded a peace with Sweden. A confederation
  was now formed in Poland against the Saxon troops, but through the
  mediation of Peter an arrangement was concluded by which the Saxon troops
  were removed from the kingdom. Augustus now gave himself up to
  voluptuousness and a life of pleasure. His Court was one of the most
  splendid and polished in Europe. The Poles yielded but too readily to the
  example of their king, and the last years of his reign were characterized
  by boundless luxury and corruption of manners. His wife left him one son.
  The Countess of Königsmark bore him the celebrated commander Marshal Saxe
  (Maurice of Saxony).</p>

  <p><b>Augustus III</b> (or <b>Frederick Augustus II</b>), Elector of
  Saxony and King of Poland, son of Augustus II, born at Dresden 1696,
  succeeded his father as Elector in 1733, and was chosen King of Poland
  through the influence of Austria and Russia. He closely followed the
  example of his father, distinguishing himself by the splendour of his
  feasts and the extravagance of his Court. He preferred Dresden to Warsaw,
  and through his long absence from Poland the government sank into entire
  inactivity. During the first Silesian war he formed a secret alliance
  with Austria. The consequence was that during the second Silesian war
  Frederick the Great of Prussia pushed on into Saxony, and occupied the
  capital, from which Augustus fled. By the peace of Dresden, 25th Dec.,
  1745, he was reinstated in the possession of Saxony. In 1756 he was
  involved anew in a war against Prussia. When Frederick declined his
  proposal of neutrality he left Dresden, and entered the camp at Pirna,
  where 17,000 Saxon troops were assembled. Frederick surrounded the
  Saxons, who were obliged to surrender, and Augustus fled to Poland. On
  the threat of invasion by Russia he returned to Dresden, where he died in
  1763. His son, Frederick Christian, succeeded him as Elector of Saxony,
  and Stanislaus Poniatowski as King of Poland.</p>

  gair-fowl, a bird about 3 feet in length, used to be plentiful in
  northerly regions, and also visited the British shores, but has become
  extinct. Some seventy skins, about as many eggs, with bones representing
  perhaps a hundred individuals, are preserved in various <!-- Page 313

  Though the largest species of the family, the wings were only 6 inches
  from the carpal joint to the tip, totally useless for flight, but
  employed as fins in swimming, especially under water. The tail was about
  3 inches long; the beak was high, short, and compressed; the head, neck,
  and upper parts were blackish; a large spot under each eye, and most of
  the under parts white. Its legs were placed so far back as to cause it to
  sit nearly upright. The razor-bill is about 15 inches in length, and its
  wings are sufficiently developed to be used for flight. It is found in
  numbers on some parts of the British shores, as the Isle of Man.</p>

  <p><b>Aure´lius Antoni´nus</b>, Marcus, often called simply <b>Marcus

  successor of Antoninus Pius, born <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 121,
  succeeded to the throne 161, died 180. His name originally was Marcus
  Annius Verus. He voluntarily shared the government with Lucius Verus,
  whom Antoninus Pius had also adopted. Brought up and instructed by
  Plutarch's nephew, Sextus, the orator Herodes Atticus, and L. Volusius
  Mecianus, the jurist, he had become acquainted with learned men, and
  formed a particular love for the Stoic philosophy. A war with Parthia
  broke out in the year of his accession, and did not terminate till 166. A
  confederacy of the northern tribes now threatened Italy, while a
  frightful pestilence, brought from the East with the army, raged in Rome
  itself. Both emperors set out in person against the rebellious tribes. In
  169 Verus died, and the sole command of the war devolved on Marcus
  Aurelius, who prosecuted it with the utmost rigour, and nearly
  exterminated the Marcomanni. His victory over the Quadi (174) is
  connected with a famous legend. Dion Cassius tells us that the twelfth
  legion of the Roman army was shut up in a defile, and reduced to great
  straits for want of water, when a body of Christians enrolled in the
  legion prayed for relief. Not only was rain sent, which enabled the
  Romans to quench their thirst, but a fierce storm of hail beat upon the
  enemy, accompanied by thunder and lightning, which so terrified them that
  a complete victory was obtained, and the legion was ever after called
  <i>The Thundering Legion</i> (<i>Legio Fulminatrix</i>). After this
  victory the Marcomanni, the Quadi, as well as the rest of the barbarians,
  sued for peace. The sedition of the Syrian governor Avidius Cassius, with
  whom Faustina, the empress, was in treasonable communication, called off
  the emperor from his conquests, but before he reached Asia the rebel was
  assassinated. Aurelius returned to Rome, after visiting Egypt and Greece,
  but soon new incursions of the Marcomanni compelled him once more to take
  the field. He defeated the enemy several times, but was taken sick at
  Sirmium, and died at Vindobona (Vienna) in 180. His only extant work is
  the <i>Meditations</i>, written in Greek. It has been translated into
  most modern languages (into English first by George Long in 1862, and by
  J. Jackson in 1906). This may be regarded as a manual of practical
  morality, in which wisdom, gentleness, and benevolence are combined in
  the most fascinating manner. Many believe it to have been intended for
  the instruction of his son Commodus. Aurelius was one of the best
  emperors Rome ever saw, although his philosophy and the magnanimity of
  his character did not restrain him from the persecution of the
  Christians, whose religious doctrines he was led to believe were
  subversive of good government, and whom he charged, therefore, with
  obstinacy, the greatest social crime in the eyes of Roman authority.
  Marcus Aurelius was not so much a philosopher as a seeker after
  righteousness.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: P.&nbsp;B. Watson,

    Aurora Borealis
  </div>

  <p><b>Auro´ra Borea´lis</b>, a luminous meteoric phenomenon appearing in
  the north, most frequently in high latitudes, the corresponding
  phenomenon in the southern hemisphere being called <i>Aurora
  Australis</i>, and both being also called <i>Polar Light</i>,
  <i>Streamers</i>, &amp;c. The northern aurora has been far the most
  observed and studied. It usually manifests itself by streams of light
  ascending towards the zenith from a dusky line of cloud or haze a few
  degrees above the horizon, and stretching from the north towards the west
  and east, so as to form an arc with its ends on the horizon, and its
  different parts and rays are constantly in motion. Sometimes it appears
  in detached places; at other times it almost covers the whole sky. It
  assumes many shapes and a variety of colours, from a pale red or yellow
  to a deep red or blood colour; and in far northern latitudes serves to
  illuminate the earth and cheer the gloom of the long winter nights. The
  appearance of the aurora borealis so exactly resembles the effects of
  experimental electrical phenomena that there is every reason to believe
  that their causes are similar. When electricity passes through rarefied
  air it exhibits a diffused luminous stream which has all the
  characteristic appearances of the aurora, and hence it is highly probable
  that this natural phenomenon is occasioned by the passage of electricity
  through the upper regions of the atmosphere. The synchronism of auroral
  display with disturbances of the magnetic needle is an ascertained fact,
  and the connection between auroræ and magnetism is further evident from
  the fact that the beams or coruscations <!-- Page 316 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page316"></a>[316]</span>issuing from a point in
  the horizon west of north are frequently observed to run in the magnetic
  meridian. What are known as magnetic storms are invariably connected with
  exhibitions of the aurora, and with spontaneous galvanic currents in the
  ordinary telegraph wires; and this connection is found to be so certain
  that, upon remarking the display of one of the three classes of
  phenomena, we can at once assert that the other two are also present. In
  recent years it has been established that auroræ wax and wane in
  frequency <i>pari passu</i> with sun-spots in an 11-year cycle, and that
  they often manifest themselves about the time of transit of a conspicuous
  spot across the sun's central meridian. Also they frequently recur at
  successive intervals of about 27 days, which is the period of a solar
  rotation relative to the earth. It is therefore inferred that auroræ are
  largely excited by influences proceeding from the sun, and it is
  suggested that they are the result of the impinging upon our upper
  atmosphere of streams of electric corpuscles expelled from the solar orb,
  these streams when approaching our planet being mainly directed to its
  higher latitudes as a consequence of its magnetic polarity. The aurora
  borealis is said to be frequently accompanied by sound, which is
  variously described as resembling the rustling of pieces of silk against
  each other, or the sound of wind against the flame of a candle. The
  aurora of the southern hemisphere is quite a similar phenomenon to that
  of the north.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: A. Angot,

  successfully or not, without supplying any further information.
  Magistrates possessed the right of taking the auspices, in which they

  general always took the auspices, and hence the operations were said to
  be carried out 'under his auspices'. See <i>Augur</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Australia</b> (older name, <b>New Holland</b>), the largest island
  in the world, a sea-girt continent, lying between the Indian and Pacific
  Oceans, <span class="scac">S.E.</span> of Asia; between lat. 10° 39' and
  39° 11' <span class="scac">S.</span>; long. 113° 5' and 153° 16' <span

  greatest breadth, from <span class="scac">N.</span> to <span
  class="scac">S.</span>, 1700 to 1900 miles. It is separated from New
  Guinea on the north by Torres Strait, from Tasmania on the south by Bass
  Strait. It is divided into two unequal parts by the Tropic of Capricorn,
  and consequently belongs partly to the South Temperate, partly to the
  Torrid Zone. It is occupied by five British colonies, namely, New South
  Wales, Victoria, and Queensland in the east; South Australia in the
  middle, stretching from sea to sea; and Western Australia in the west,
  which, with the Island of Tasmania, form the Commonwealth of Australia.

  <p>Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, and Perth are the chief towns.
  The population of the Commonwealth of Australia was 4,895,894 in 1917 and
  5,412,318 in 1920.</p>

  <p>Although there are numerous spacious harbours on the coasts, there are
  few remarkable indentations, the principal being the Gulf of Carpentaria,
  on the <span class="scac">N.</span>, the Great Australian Bight, and
  Spencer's Gulf, on the <span class="scac">S.</span> The chief projections
  are Cape York Peninsula and Arnhem Land in the north. Parallel to the
  <span class="scac">N.E.</span> coast runs the Great Barrier Reef for 1000
  miles. In great part the <span class="scac">E.</span> coast is bold and
  rocky, and is fringed with many small islands. Part of the <span
  class="scac">S.</span> coast is low and sandy, and part presents cliffs
  of several hundred feet high. The <span class="scac">N.</span> and <span
  class="scac">W.</span> coasts are generally low, with some elevations at
  intervals.</p>

  <p>The interior, so far as explored, is largely composed of rocky tracts
  and barren plains with little or no water. The whole continent forms an
  immense plateau, highest in the east, low in the centre, and with a
  narrow tract of land usually intervening between the elevated area and
  the sea. The base of the table-land is granite, which forms the
  surface-rock in a great part of the south-west, and is common in the
  higher grounds along the east side. Secondary (cretaceous) and tertiary
  rocks are largely developed in the interior. Silurian rocks occupy a
  large area in South Australia, on both sides of Spencer Gulf. The
  mountainous region in the south-east and east is mainly composed of
  volcanic, Silurian, carbonaceous, and carboniferous rocks yielding good
  coal. No active volcano is known to exist, but in the south-east there
  are some craters only recently extinct. The highest and most extensive
  mountain-system is a belt about 150 miles wide skirting the whole eastern
  and south-eastern border of the continent, and often called, in whole or
  in part, the Great Dividing Range, from forming the great water-shed of
  Australia. A part of it, called the Australian Alps, in the south-east,
  contains the highest summits in Australia, Mount Kosciusko (7175 feet),
  Mount <!-- Page 318 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page318"></a>[318]</span>Clarke (7256 feet), and Mount Townshend
  (7353 feet). West of the Dividing Range are extensive plains or downs
  admirably adapted for pastoral purposes. The deserts and scrubs, which
  occupy large areas of the interior, are a characteristic feature of
  Australia. The former are destitute of vegetation, or are covered only
  with a coarse, spiny grass that affords no sustenance to cattle or
  horses; the latter are composed of a dense growth of shrubs and low
  trees, often impenetrable till the traveller has cleared a track with his
  axe.</p>

  <p>The rivers of Australia are nearly all subject to great irregularities
  in volume, many of them at one time showing a channel in which there is
  merely a series of pools, while at another they inundate the whole
  adjacent country. The chief is the Murray, which, with its affluents the
  Murrumbidgee, Lachlan, and Darling, drains a great part of the interior
  west of the Dividing Range, and falls into the sea on the south coast
  (after entering Lake Alexandrina). Its greatest tributary is the Darling,
  which may even be regarded as the main stream. On the east coast are the
  Hunter, Clarence, Brisbane, Fitzroy, and Burdekin; on the west, the Swan,
  Murchison, Gascoyne, Ashburton, and De Grey; on the north, the Fitzroy,
  Victoria, Flinders, and Mitchell. The Australian rivers are of little
  service in facilitating internal communication. Many of them lose
  themselves in swamps or sandy wastes of the interior. A considerable
  river of the interior is Cooper's Creek, or the Barcoo, which falls into
  Lake Eyre, one of a group of lakes on the south side of the continent
  having no outlet, and accordingly salt. The principal of these are Lakes
  Eyre, Torrens, and Gairdner, all of which vary in size and saltness
  according to the season. Another large salt lake of little depth, Lake
  Amadeus, lies a little west of the centre of Australia. Various others of
  less magnitude are scattered over the interior.</p>

  <p>The climate of Australia is generally hot and dry, but very healthy.
  In the tropical portions there are heavy rains, and in most of the coast
  districts there is a sufficiency of moisture, but in the interior the
  heat and drought are extreme. Considerable portions now devoted to
  pasturage are liable at times to suffer from drought. At Melbourne the
  mean temperature is about 56°, at Sydney about 63°. The south-eastern
  settled districts are at times subject to excessively hot winds from the
  interior, which cause great discomfort, and are often followed by a
  violent cold wind from the south ('southerly bursters'). In the
  mountainous and more temperate parts snow-storms are common in winter
  (June, July, and August).</p>

  <p>Australia is a region containing a vast quantity of mineral wealth.
  Foremost come its rich and extensive deposits of gold, which, since the
  precious metal was first discovered in 1851, have produced a total of
  nearly £600,000,000. The greatest quantity has been obtained in Victoria,
  <!-- Page 319 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page319"></a>[319]</span>but New South Wales and Queensland have
  also yielded a considerable amount, and now Western Australia stands
  first in respect of annual output. Australia also possesses silver,
  copper, tin, lead, zinc, antimony, mercury, plumbago, &amp;c., besides
  coal (now worked to a considerable extent in New South Wales) and iron.
  Various precious stones are found, as the garnet, ruby, topaz, sapphire,
  and even the diamond. Of building-stone there are granite, limestone,
  marble, and sandstone.</p>

  <p>The Australian flora presents peculiarities which mark it off by
  itself in a very decided manner. Many of its most striking features have
  an unmistakable relation to the general dryness of the climate. The trees
  and bushes have for the most part a scanty foliage, presenting little
  surface for evaporation, or thick leathery leaves well fitted to retain
  moisture. The most widely-spread types of Australian vegetation are the
  various kinds of gum tree (<i>Eucalyptus</i>), the shea-oak
  (<i>Casuar&#x12B;na</i>), the acacia or wattle, the grass tree
  (<i>Xanthorrh&oelig;a</i>), many varieties of Proteaceæ, and a great
  number of ferns and tree-ferns. Of the gum tree there are found upwards
  of 150 species, many of which are of great value. Individual specimens of
  the 'peppermint' (<i>E. amygdal&#x12D;na</i>) have been found to measure
  from 480 to 500 feet in height. As timber trees the most valuable members
  of this genus are the <i>E. rostr&#x101;ta</i> (or red gum), <i>E.
  leucox&#x45E;lon</i>, and <i>E. margin&#x101;ta</i> (jarrah), the timber
  of which is hard, and almost indestructible. A number of the gum trees
  have deciduous bark. The wattle or acacia includes about 300 species,
  some of them of considerable economic value, yielding good timber or bark
  for tanning. The most beautiful and most useful is that known as the
  golden wattle (<i>A. dealb&#x101;ta</i>) which in spring is adorned with
  rich masses of fragrant yellow blossom. Palms&mdash;of which there are
  twenty-four species, all except the coco-palm peculiar to
  Australia&mdash;are confined to the north and east coasts. In the
  'scrubs' already mentioned hosts of densely-intertwisted bushes occupy
  extensive areas. The <i>mallee</i> scrub is formed by a species of dwarf
  eucalyptus, the <i>mulga</i> scrub by a species of thorny acacia. A plant
  which covers large areas in the arid regions is the <i>spinifex</i> or
  porcupine grass, a hard, coarse, and excessively spiny plant, which
  renders travelling difficult, wounds the feet of horses, and is utterly
  uneatable by any animal. Other large tracts are occupied by herbs or
  bushes of a more valuable kind, from their affording fodder. Foremost
  among those stands the salt-bush (<i>Atriplex nummularia</i>, ord.
  Chenopodiaceæ). Beautiful flowering plants are numerous. Australia also
  possesses great numbers of turf-forming grasses, such as the
  kangaroo-grass (<i>Anthistiria austr&#x101;lis</i>), which survives even
  a tolerably-protracted drought. The native fruit trees are few and
  unimportant, and the same may be said of the plants yielding roots used
  as food; but exotic fruits and vegetables may now be had in the different
  colonies in great abundance and of excellent quality. The vine, the
  olive, and mulberry thrive well, and quantities of wine are now produced.
  The cereals of Europe and maize are extensively cultivated, and large
  tracts of country, particularly in Queensland, are under the
  sugar-cane.</p>

  <p>The Australian fauna is almost unique in its character. Its great
  feature is the nearly total <!-- Page 320 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page320"></a>[320]</span>absence of all the forms of mammalia which
  abound in the rest of the world, their place being supplied by a great
  variety of marsupials&mdash;these animals being nowhere else found,
  except in the opossums of America. There are about 110 kinds of
  marsupials (of which the kangaroo, wombat, bandicoot, and phalangers or
  opossums, are the best-known varieties), over twenty kinds of bats, a
  wild dog (the dingo), and a number of rats and mice. Two extraordinary
  animals, the platypus, or water-mole of the colonist (Ornithorhynchus),
  and the porcupine ant-eater (Echidna) constitute the lowest order of
  mammals (Monotremata), and are confined to Australia. Their young are
  produced from eggs. Australia now possesses a large stock of the domestic
  animals of Britain, which thrive there remarkably well. The breed of
  horses is excellent. Horned cattle and sheep are largely bred, the first
  attaining a great size, while the sheep improve in fleece and their flesh
  in flavour. There are upwards of 650 different species of birds, the
  largest being the emu, or Australian ostrich, and a species of cassowary.
  Peculiar to the country are the black swan, the honey-sucker, the
  lyre-bird, the brush-turkey, and other mound-building birds, the
  bower-birds, &amp;c. The parrot tribe preponderates over most other
  groups of birds in the continent. There are many reptiles, the largest
  being the alligator, found in some of the northern rivers. There are
  upwards of sixty different species of snakes, some of which are very
  venomous. Lizards, frogs, and insects are also numerous in various parts.
  The seas, rivers, and lagoons abound in fish of numerous varieties, and
  other aquatic animals, many of them peculiar. Whales and seals frequent
  the coasts. On the northern coasts are extensive fisheries of trepang,
  much visited by native traders from the Indian Archipelago. Some animals
  of European origin, such as the rabbit and the sparrow, have developed
  into real pests in several of the colonies.</p>

    COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA Surface Features
  </div>

  <p>The natives belong to the Australian negro stock, and are sometimes
  considered the lowest as regards intelligence in the whole human family,
  though this is doubtful. At the census of 1891 they were believed to
  number about 60,000, exclusive of those in the unexplored parts. They are
  of a dark-brown or black colour, with jet-black curly but not woolly
  hair, of medium size, but inferior muscular development. In the settled
  parts of the continent they are inoffensive, and rapidly dying out. They
  have no fixed habitations; in the summer they live almost entirely in the
  open air, and in the more inclement weather they shelter themselves with
  bark erections of the rudest construction. They have no cultivation and
  no domestic animals. Their food consists of such animals as they can
  kill, and no kind of living creature seems to be rejected, snakes,
  lizards, frogs, and even insects being eaten, often half raw. They are
  ignorant of the potter's art. <!-- Page 321 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page321"></a>[321]</span>In their natural condition they wear
  little or no clothing. They speak a number of different languages or
  dialects. The women are regarded merely as slaves, and are frequently
  maltreated. They have no religion; they practise polygamy, and are said
  sometimes to resort to cannibalism, but only in exceptional
  circumstances. They are occasionally employed by the settlers in light
  kinds of work, and as horse-breakers; but they dislike continuous
  occupation, and soon give it up. The weapons of all the tribes are
  generally similar, consisting of spears, shields, boomerangs, wooden
  axes, clubs, and stone hatchets. Of these the boomerang is the most
  singular, being an invention confined to the Australians.</p>

  <p>The five colonies, independently of each other, having declared their
  desire for a federal union, the Commonwealth of Australia was proclaimed.
  A Convention, which sat at Adelaide in 1897-8, drafted a Constitution
  Bill, and on 9th July, 1900, the British Parliament passed the Act to
  constitute the Commonwealth. There is now a Governor-General and Central
  or Federal Parliament, consisting of a Senate and a House of
  Representatives, while each State has also (as before) a Governor, an
  administration, and a Parliament of its own. Each Parliament consists of
  two Houses corresponding to the British House of Lords and House of
  Commons, but both Houses are elected by popular vote. Altogether the
  machinery of government very much resembles that of the home country. The
  aggregate annual revenue of the colonies is over £30,000,000. The public
  debt on 30th June, 1917, was £372,517,623. The former militia and
  volunteer units have been gradually merged into the new Citizen Army
  started by the Australian Government in 1911. The Government also agreed
  in the same year to furnish an Australian fleet unit, upon which King
  George conferred the title of 'Royal Australian Navy'. There is no
  established Church in the colonies. The denomination which numbers most
  adherents is the English or Anglican Church, next to which come the Roman
  Catholics, Presbyterians, and Methodists. Education is well provided for,
  instruction in the primary schools being in some cases free and
  compulsory, and the higher education being more and more attended to.
  There are flourishing universities in Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide.
  Newspapers are exceedingly numerous, and periodicals of all kinds are
  abundant. There is as yet no native literature of any distinctive type,
  but names of Australian writers of ability both in prose and poetry are
  beginning to be known beyond their own country.</p>

  <p>Pastoral and agricultural pursuits and mining are the chief
  occupations of the people, though manufactures and handicrafts also
  employ large numbers. The total land area under cultivation was
  calculated at 13,298,576 acres in 1919-20. For sheep-rearing and the
  growth of wool the Australian colonies are unrivalled, and while the
  production of gold has considerably decreased, that of wool is constantly
  on the increase. The great bulk of the wool exported goes to Britain,
  which receives over 300,000,000 pounds from the Australian colonies
  annually (£37,256,915 in 1919-20). The commerce is rapidly extending, and
  becoming every year more important to Britain, whence the colonists
  derive their chief supplies of manufactured goods in return for wool,
  gold, and other produce. Next to wool come gold, tin, copper, wheat,
  preserved meat, and tallow, hides and skins, cotton, tobacco, sugar, and
  wine as the most important items of export. The chief imports consist of
  textile fabrics, haberdashery, and clothing, machinery and metal goods.
  The aggregate imports in 1920 amounted to about £97,456,899 in value, the
  exports to £148,564,523. There are upwards of 23,000 miles of railway in
  actual use or in course of construction, and about 133,000 miles of
  telegraph. In 1912 the building of the Trans-Australian railway from Port
  Augusta to Kalgoorlie was commenced. The longest telegraph line is that
  running northwards across the continent from Adelaide. The two chief
  routes for mails between Britain and the Australian colonies are by way
  of the Suez Canal, and by San Francisco across the American continent.
  The coinage is the same as in the mother country. Banks and banking
  offices are numerous, including post office or other savings banks for
  the reception of small sums.</p>

  <p>It is doubtful when Australia was first discovered by Europeans.
  Between 1531 and 1542 the Portuguese published the existence of a land
  which they called Great Java, and which corresponded to Australia, and
  probably the first discovery of the country was made by them early in the
  sixteenth century. The first authenticated discovery is said to have been
  made in 1601 by a Portuguese named Manoel Godinho de Eredia. In 1606
  Torres, a Spaniard, passed through the strait that now bears his name,
  between New Guinea and Australia. Between this period and 1628 a large
  portion of the coastline of Australia had been surveyed by various Dutch
  navigators. In 1664 the continent was named New Holland by the Dutch
  Government. In 1688 Dampier coasted along part of Australia, and about
  1700 explored a part of the <span class="scac">W.</span> and <span
  class="scac">N.W.</span> coasts. In 1770 Cook carefully surveyed the
  <span class="scac">E.</span> coast, named a number of localities, and
  took possession of the country for Britain. He was followed by Bligh in
  1789, who carried on a series of observations on the <span
  class="scac">N.E.</span> coast, adding largely to the knowledge already
  obtained of this new world. Colonists had now arrived on the <!-- Page
  322 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page322"></a>[322]</span>soil, and
  a penal settlement was formed (1788) at Port Jackson. In this way was
  laid the foundation of the future colony of New South Wales. The Moreton
  Bay district (Queensland) was settled in 1825; in 1835 the Port Phillip
  district. In 1851 the latter district was erected into a separate colony
  under the name of Victoria. Previous to this time the colonies both of
  Western Australia and of South Australia had been founded&mdash;the
  former in 1829, the latter in 1836. The latest of the colonies is
  Queensland, which dates from 1859. The discovery of gold in abundance
  took place in 1851 and caused an immense excitement and great influx of
  immigrants. The population was then only about 350,000, and was slowly
  increasing; but the discovery of the precious metal started the country
  on that career of prosperity which has since been almost uninterrupted.
  Convicts were long sent to Australia from the mother country, but
  transportation to New South Wales practically ceased in 1840, and the
  last convict vessel to W. Australia arrived in 1868. Altogether about
  70,000 convicts were landed in Australia (besides almost as many in
  Tasmania).</p>

  <p>The record of interior exploration forms an interesting part of
  Australian history. This has been going on since early last century, and
  is as yet far from complete. There is still a large area of the continent
  of which little or nothing is known, comprising especially a vast
  territory belonging to Western Australia, and a portion of South
  Australia. Among the men who have won fame in the field of Australian
  exploration are Oxley (1817-23), who partly explored the Lachlan and
  Macquarie, discovered the Brisbane, &amp;c.; Hume and Hovell (1824), who
  crossed what is now the colony of Victoria from north to south;
  Cunningham (1827), who discovered the Darling Downs; Sturt (1828-9), who
  examined the Macquarie, part of the Darling, and the Murrumbidgee, which
  he traced to the Murray, sailing down the latter to Lake Alexandrina; in
  1844 he penetrated to near the middle of the continent from the south;
  Mitchell (1831-6) made extensive explorations in New South Wales and
  Victoria; M&lsquo;Millan (1839) explored and traversed Gippsland; Eyre
  (1840) travelled by the coast from Adelaide to King George's Sound;
  Leichhardt in 1844-5 travelled from Brisbane to Port Essington,
  discovering fine tracts of territory and the numerous rivers flowing into
  the Gulf of Carpentaria; in 1848 he was lost in the northern interior, in
  attempting to cross Australia from east to west, and nothing further
  regarding his fate has been discovered; Kennedy (1848) was killed in
  exploring Cape York Peninsula; A.&nbsp;C. Gregory (1855-6) explored part of
  North-Western Australia, and crossed from that to the Brisbane district,
  an important exploring journey; M&lsquo;Douall Stuart (1859-60-2) crossed
  the continent from south to north and back again nearly in the line of
  the present overland telegraph; Burke, Wills, Gray, and King (1860-1)
  crossed from Melbourne to the Gulf of Carpentaria, but Burke, Wills, and
  Gray perished on the return journey; F.&nbsp;T. Gregory (1861) explored the
  region of the Ashburton, Fortescue, and other rivers of North-West
  Australia; Warburton (1873) travelled with camels from the centre of the
  continent to the north-west coast; J. Forrest (1874) made an important
  journey in Western Australia; Giles (1874-6) explored Central Western
  Australia; Favenc (1878-9) travelled from Brisbane to Port Darwin; A.
  Forrest (1879) explored part of Northern Australia; Mills (1883)
  traversed with camels a considerable stretch of new ground in Western
  Australia; Winnicke (1883-4), also with camels, explored and mapped about
  40,000 sq. miles of the unknown interior; Lindsay (1885-6) travelled
  north-west from Lake Eyre, and then north-east to the Gulf of
  Carpentaria. Among subsequent explorations mention may be made of
  Carnegie's eight months' journeyings in W. Australia (1896-7). (See

  provisionally defined by the treaty of St. Germain (q.v.), includes Upper
  Austria, Lower Austria, Salzburg, and parts of Styria, Carinthia, Tyrol,
  and Vorarlberg, some districts having been assigned to Yugo-Slavia and

  monarchy, and the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina annexed by Austria
  on 5th Oct., 1908. The States had together a total area of about 261,242
  sq. miles, and were bounded <span class="scac">S.</span> by Turkey, the
  Adriatic, and Italy; <span class="scac">W.</span> by Switzerland,

  name="page323"></a>[323]</span>Saxony; <span class="scac">N.</span> by
  Prussia and Russian Poland; and <span class="scac">E.</span> by Russia
  and Roumania. On 12th Nov., 1918, the German-Austrian Republic was
  proclaimed, and the government was taken in hand by the National
  Constitutional Assembly. The account given in the following pages applies
  to the countries only as they existed before the end of the European
  War.</p>

  <p>The population of Austria proper in 1913 was estimated at
  29,193,293.</p>

  <p>The prevailing character of the Austrian dominions is mountainous or
  hilly, the plains not occupying more than a fifth part of the whole
  surface. The loftiest ranges belong to the Alps, and are found in Styria,
  Salzburg, and Carinthia, the highest summits being the Ortlerspitzen
  (12,814 feet) on the western boundary of Tyrol, and the Grossglockner
  (12,300 feet) on the borders of Salzburg, Tyrol, and Carinthia. Another
  great range is that of the Carpathians. The chief rivers are the Danube,
  with its tributaries, and the Dniester. The Danube is navigable for
  pretty large vessels; the tributaries also are largely navigable. The
  lakes are numerous and often picturesque, the chief being Lake Balaton or
  the Plattensee. The climate is exceedingly varied, but generally good.
  The principal products of the north are wheat, barley, oats, and rye; in
  the centre vines and maize are added; and in the south olives and various
  fruits. The cereals grow to perfection, other crops being hops, tobacco,
  flax, and hemp. Sheep and cattle are largely reared.&mdash;Wild deer,
  wild swine, chamois, foxes, lynxes, and a species of small black bear are
  found in many districts, the fox and lynx being particularly
  abundant.&mdash;In mineral productions Austria is very rich, possessing,
  with the exception of platinum, all the useful metals, the total annual
  value of the mineral products of Austria being estimated at upwards of
  £15,000,000, the principal being coal, salt, and iron.</p>

  <p>Before the European War, manufactures were in the most flourishing
  condition in Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, and Lower Austria; less so in the
  eastern provinces, and insignificant in Dalmatia, Bukowina, Herzegovina,
  &amp;c. Among the most important manufactures were those of machinery and
  metal goods, Austria holding a high place for the manufacture of musical
  and scientific instruments, gold and silver plate and jewellery; of stone
  and china-ware and of glass, which is one of the oldest and most
  highly-developed industries in Austria; of chemicals; of sugar from beet;
  of beer, spirits, &amp;c.; and especially the manufactures of wool,
  cotton, hemp, and flax.</p>

  <p>In addition to the general import and export trade, Austria carried on
  a very considerable amount of business in the transit of goods through
  her territory. In 1914 the total value of imports into Austria-Hungary
  was £114,716,000, of exports £83,996,000; the value of imports in 1913
  was £141,433,000, the exports £115,129,000. Among imports were cotton and
  other fibres, textile goods and yarn, metals, machinery, drugs,
  chemicals, oils, fats, hides, skins, &amp;c. The chief exports were
  cereals, animals, metallic goods, woven fabrics, pottery and glass
  manufactures. Nearly two-thirds of the commerce are with Germany, next in
  importance being the trade with Roumania, Italy, and Russia. The exports
  direct to the United Kingdom in 1913 were £7,705,949; the imports of
  British produce direct, £4,480,760; but these amounts do not include
  indirect exports and imports through other countries. The staple exports
  to the United Kingdom were corn and flour. The chief imports from it were
  cotton manufactures, machinery and metals, woollen goods, fish, &amp;c.
  In 1913 the mercantile navy of Austria had a total burden of about
  471,252 tons. The principal ports were Trieste, in Austria, and Fiume, in
  Hungary.</p>

  <p>None of the European States, except Russia, exhibited such a diversity
  of race and language as the former dual monarchy. The Slavs&mdash;who
  differ greatly, however, amongst themselves in language and
  civilization&mdash;amounted to above 20,000,000, or 46 per cent of the
  total population, and formed the great mass of the population of Bohemia,
  Moravia, Carniola, Galicia, Dalmatia, Croatia, and Slavonia, and Northern
  Hungary, and half the population of Silesia and Bukowina. The Germans,
  about 9,950,266, formed almost the sole population of the archduchy of
  Austria, Salzburg, the greatest portion of Styria and Carinthia, almost
  the whole of Tyrol and Vorarlberg, large portions of Bohemia and Moravia,
  the whole of West Silesia, &amp;c.; and they were also numerous in
  Hungary and Transylvania. The Magyars or Hungarians (10,061,549) formed
  nearly half of the inhabitants of the former Kingdom of Hungary and the
  connected provinces.</p>

  <p>The State religion of the former dual monarchy was the Roman Catholic.
  In 1910 there were in the Austrian portion of the monarchy 22,530,000
  Roman Catholics, 3,417,000 Greek Catholics united to the Roman Church,
  689,000 non-united, 589,000 Protestants, and 1,314,000 Jews.</p>

  <p>The intellectual culture of the people was highest in the German
  provinces, but in some of the other provinces the percentage of
  uneducated was very high. Attendance at the elementary schools was
  compulsory on all children from their sixth to the end of their
  fourteenth year in most of the Austrian provinces; to at least the
  twelfth year in the whole empire. There were numerous gymnasia and 'real
  schools', the gymnasia being <!-- Page 324 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page324"></a>[324]</span>intended chiefly to prepare pupils for the
  universities, while in the real schools a more practical end was kept in
  view, and modern languages and physical science formed the groundwork of
  the educational course. The technical high schools in Austria were very
  important institutions, and there are many other special schools where
  the students received training in mining, agriculture, industries of all
  kinds, art, music, commerce, &amp;c. In 1917 there were eight
  universities maintained by the State, viz. in Vienna, Prague (2), Gratz,
  Cracow, Lemberg, Innsbruck, and Czernowitz. Most of these have four
  faculties&mdash;Catholic theology, law and politics, medicine, and
  philosophy.</p>

  <p>Before the revolution of 1918 the ruler of the dual monarchy had the
  title of emperor in his Austrian dominions, but he was only king of
  Hungary. The Parliament of the Austrian division of the empire was known
  as the Reichsrath, or council of the realm, consisting of an Upper House
  (Herrenhaus), composed of princes of the imperial family, nobles with the
  hereditary right to sit, archbishops, and life-members nominated by the
  Emperor; and a Lower House (Abgeordnetenhaus) of 516 deputies elected on
  the basis of universal suffrage. There were seventeen provincial Diets or
  Assemblies, each provincial division having one. In the Hungarian
  division of the Empire the legislature was a Parliament consisting of an
  Upper House or House of Magnates and of a Lower House or House of
  Representatives, the latter elected by all citizens of full age paying a
  small amount in taxes, or otherwise qualified. Its powers corresponded to
  those of the Austrian Parliament or Reichsrath. All matters affecting the
  joint interests of the two divisions of the monarchy, such as foreign
  affairs, war, and finance, were dealt with by the Parliaments of the two
  States. There were three Budgets, viz. one for common affairs, one for
  Austria, and one for Hungary. The Budget estimates for the former
  Austrian kingdom in 1913 were £130,716,773 (the revenue balancing the
  expenditure). In 1918 the estimates were: expenditure 24,321,140,000
  crowns, revenue 4,854,789 crowns. Austria's special debt in Feb., 1918,
  was placed at 54,081,765,681 crowns, of which 29,274,603,300 crowns were
  war debt. On 20th Nov., 1918, the Provisional Government of the Austrian
  Republic passed a law adopting the Budget of 1918-9, and empowering the
  Minister of Finance to make good the difference between revenue and
  expenditure.</p>

  <p>Military service was compulsory and universal throughout the dual
  monarchy. The old Austro-Hungarian army numbered about 820,000 men on a
  peace footing.</p>

  <p><i>History.</i>&mdash;In 791 Charlemagne drove the Avars from the
  territory between the Ens and the Raab, and united it to his empire under
  the name of <i>the Eastern Mark</i> (that is, March or boundary land);
  and from the establishment by him of a margraviate in this new province
  the former Austrian Empire took its rise. On the invasion of Germany by
  the Hungarians it became subject to them from 900 till 955, when Otho I,
  by the victory of Augsburg, reunited a great part of this province to the
  German Empire, which by 1043 had extended its limits to the Leitha. The
  margraviate of Austria was hereditary in the family of the Counts of
  Babenberg (Bamberg) from 982 till 1156, in which year the boundaries of
  Austria were extended so as to include the territory above the Ens, and
  the whole was created a duchy. The territory was still further increased
  in 1192 by the gift of the duchy of Styria as a fief from the Emperor
  Henry VI, Vienna being by this time the capital. The male line of the
  House of Bamberg became extinct in 1246, and the Emperor Frederick II
  declared Austria and Styria a vacant fief, the hereditary property of the
  German emperors. In 1282 the Emperor Rudolph granted Austria, Styria, and
  Carinthia to his two sons, Albert and Rudolph. The former became sole
  ruler (duke), and since then, until 12th Nov., 1918, Austria remained
  under the House of Habsburg. Albert, who was an energetic ruler, was
  elected emperor in 1298, but was assassinated in 1308. The first of his
  successors whom we need specially mention was Albert V, son-in-law of the
  Emperor Sigismund. He assisted Sigismund in the Hussite wars, and was
  elected, after his death, King of Hungary and of Bohemia, and German
  emperor (1438). Ladislaus, his posthumous son, was the last of the
  Austrian line proper, and its possessions devolved upon the collateral
  Styrian line in 1457; since which time the House of Austria furnished an
  unbroken succession of German emperors.</p>

  <p>In 1453 the Emperor Frederick III, a member of this House, had
  conferred upon the country the rank of an archduchy before he himself
  became ruler of all Austria. His son Maximilian I, by his marriage with
  Mary, the surviving daughter of Charles the Bold, united the Netherlands
  to the Austrian dominions. After the death of his father, in 1493,
  Maximilian was made Emperor of Germany, and transferred to his son Philip
  the government of the Netherlands. He also added to his paternal
  inheritance Tyrol, with several other territories, particularly some
  belonging to Bavaria, and acquired for his family new claims to Hungary
  and Bohemia. The marriage of his son Philip to Joanna of Spain raised the
  House of Habsburg to the throne of Spain. Philip, however, died in 1506,
  and the death of Maximilian, in 1519, was followed by the union of Spain
  and Austria, his grandson (the eldest son of Philip), Charles I, King of
  <!-- Page 325 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page325"></a>[325]</span>Spain, being elected Emperor of Germany as
  Charles V. Charles thus became the greatest monarch in Europe, but in
  1521 he ceded to his brother Ferdinand all his dominions in Germany.
  Ferdinand I, by his marriage with Anna, the sister of Louis II, King of
  Hungary, acquired the kingdoms of Hungary and Bohemia, with Moravia,
  Silesia, and Lusatia, the appendages of Bohemia. To oppose him the
  woywode of Transylvania, John Zapolya, sought the help of the Sultan,
  Soliman II, who appeared in 1529 at the gates of Vienna, but was
  compelled to retreat. In 1535 a treaty was made by which John Zapolya was
  allowed to retain the royal title and half of Hungary, but after his
  death new disputes arose, and Ferdinand maintained the possession of
  Lower Hungary only by paying Soliman the sum of 30,000 ducats annually
  (1562). In 1556 Ferdinand obtained the imperial crown, when his brother
  Charles laid by the sceptre for a cowl. He died in 1564, leaving his
  territories to be divided amongst his three sons.</p>

  <p>Maximilian II, the eldest, succeeded his father as emperor, obtaining
  Austria, Hungary, and Bohemia; Ferdinand, the second son, received Tyrol
  and Lower Austria; and Charles, the youngest, obtained Styria, Carinthia,
  Carniola, and Görz. Maximilian died in 1576, and was succeeded on the
  imperial throne by his eldest son Rudolph II, who had already been
  crowned King of Hungary in 1572, and King of Bohemia in 1575. Rudolph's
  reign was distinguished by the war against Turkey and Transylvania; the
  persecutions of the Protestants, who were driven from his dominions; the
  cession of Hungary in 1608; and in 1611 of Bohemia and his hereditary
  estates in Austria to his brother Matthias. Matthias, who succeeded
  Maximilian on the imperial throne, concluded a peace with the Turks, but
  was disturbed by the Protestant Bohemians, who took up arms in defence of
  their religious rights, thus commencing the Thirty Years' War. After his
  death in 1619 the Bohemians refused to acknowledge his successor,
  Ferdinand II, until after the battle of Prague in 1620, when Bohemia had
  to submit, and was deprived of the right of choosing her king.
  Lutheranism was strictly forbidden in all the Austrian dominions.
  Hungary, which revolted under Bethlem Gabor, Prince of Transylvania, was,
  after a long struggle, subdued. During the reign of Ferdinand III
  (1637-57), successor of Ferdinand II, Austria was continually the theatre
  of war; Lusatia was ceded to Saxony in 1635; and Alsace to France in
  1648, when peace was restored in Germany by the Treaty of Westphalia.</p>

  <p>The Emperor Leopold I, son and successor of Ferdinand III, was
  victorious through the talents of Prince Eugene in two wars with Turkey;
  and Vienna was delivered by Sobieski and the Germans from the attacks of
  Kara Mustapha in 1683. In 1687 he united Hungary to Transylvania, and in
  1699 restored to Hungary the country lying between the Danube and the
  Theiss. It was the chief aim of Leopold to secure to Charles, his second
  son, the inheritance of the Spanish monarchy, and in 1701, upon the
  victory of French diplomacy in the appointment of the grandson of Louis
  XIV, the War of the Spanish Succession commenced. Leopold died in 1705,
  but Joseph I, his eldest son, continued the war. As he died without
  children in 1711, his brother Charles was elected emperor, but was
  obliged to accede in 1714 to the Peace of Utrecht, by which Austria
  received the Netherlands, Milan, Mantua, Naples, and Sardinia. In 1720
  Sicily was given to Austria in exchange for Sardinia. This monarchy now
  embraced over 190,000 sq. miles; but its power was weakened by new wars
  with Spain and France. In the peace concluded at Vienna (1735 and 1738)
  Charles VI was forced to cede Naples and Sicily to Spain and part of
  Milan to the King of Sardinia; and in 1739, by the Peace of Belgrade, he
  was obliged to transfer to the Porte Belgrade, Serbia, &amp;c., partly in
  order to secure the succession to his daughter, Maria Theresa, by the
  Pragmatic Sanction. He died in 1740.</p>

  <p>On Maria Theresa's marriage to Francis Stephen, Duke of Lorraine (the
  dynasty henceforth being that of Habsburg-Lorraine), and her accession to
  the Austrian throne, the Empire was threatened with dismemberment.
  Frederick II of Prussia subdued Silesia; the Elector of Bavaria was
  crowned in Lintz and Prague, and in 1742 chosen emperor under the name of
  Charles VII; Hungary alone supported the heroic and beautiful queen.
  Charles, however, died in 1745, and the husband of Theresa was crowned
  Emperor of Germany as Francis I; but a treaty concluded in 1745 confirmed
  to Frederick the possession of Silesia, and by the Peace of
  Aix-la-Chapelle, 1748, Austria was obliged to cede the duchies of Parma,
  Piacenza, and Guastalla to Philip, Infant of Spain, and several districts
  of Milan and Sardinia. To recover Silesia, Maria Theresa formed an
  alliance with France, Russia, Saxony, and Sweden, and entered upon the
  Seven Years' War; but by the Peace of Hubertsberg, 1763, Silesia was
  recognized as Prussian territory. On the death of Francis I, in 1765,
  Joseph II, his eldest son, was appointed to assist his mother in the
  government and elected Emperor of Germany. The partition of Poland (1772)
  gave Galicia and Lodomeria to Austria, which also obtained Bukowina from
  the Porte in 1777. At the death of the Empress in 1780 Austria contained
  235,000 sq. miles, with a pop. estimated at 24,000,000.</p>

  <p>The liberal home administration of the Empress <!-- Page 326 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page326"></a>[326]</span>was continued and
  extended by her successor, Joseph II, who did much to further the spread
  of religious tolerance, education, and the industrial arts. The Low
  Countries, however, revolted, and he was unsuccessful in the war of 1788
  against the Porte. His death took place in 1790. He was succeeded by his
  eldest brother, Leopold II, under whom peace was restored in the
  Netherlands, and in Hungary, and also with the Porte. On the death of his
  sister and her husband Louis XVI of France he formed an alliance with
  Prussia, but died in 1792, before the French revolutionary war broke
  out.</p>

  <p>His son, Francis II, succeeded, and was elected German Emperor, by
  which time France had declared war against him as King of Hungary and
  Bohemia. In 1795, in the third partition of Poland, West Galicia fell to
  Austria, and by the Peace of Campo-Formio (1797) she received the largest
  part of the Venetian territory as compensation for her loss of Lombardy
  and the Netherlands. In 1799 Francis, in alliance with Russia, renewed
  the war with France until 1801, when the Peace of Lunéville was
  concluded. In 1804 Francis declared himself hereditary Emperor of Austria
  as Francis I, and united all his States under the name of the Empire of
  Austria, immediately taking up arms once more with his allies Russia and
  Great Britain against France. The war of 1805 was terminated by the Peace
  of Pressburg (26th Dec.), by which Francis had to cede to France the
  remaining provinces of Italy, as well as to give up portions of territory
  to Bavaria, Würtemberg, and Baden, receiving in return Salzburg and
  Berchtesgaden. After the formation of the Confederation of the Rhine
  (12th July, 1806) Francis was forced to resign his dignity as Emperor of
  Germany, which had been in his family more than 500 years. A new war with
  France in 1809 cost the monarchy 42,380 sq. miles of territory and
  3,500,000 subjects. Napoleon married Maria Louisa, daughter of the
  Emperor, and in 1812 concluded an alliance with him against Russia. But
  in 1813 Francis again declared war against France, and formed an alliance
  with Britain, Prussia, and Sweden against his son-in-law. By the Congress
  of Vienna (1815) Austria gained Lombardy and Venetia, and recovered,
  together with Dalmatia, the hereditary territories which it had been
  obliged to cede.</p>

  <p>In the troubled period following the French revolution of 1830
  insurrections took place in Modena, Parma, and the Papal States (1831-2),
  but were suppressed without much difficulty; and though professedly
  neutral during the Polish insurrections Austria clearly showed herself on
  the side of Russia, with whom her relations became more intimate as those
  between Great Britain and France grew more cordial. The death of Francis
  I (1835) and accession of his son, Ferdinand I, made little change in the
  Austrian system of government, and much discontent was the consequence.
  In 1846 the failure of the Polish insurrection led to the incorporation
  of Cracow with Austria. In Italy the declarations of Pio Nono in favour
  of reform increased the difficulties of Austria, and in Hungary the
  opposition under Kossuth and others assumed the form of a great
  constitutional movement. In 1848, when the expulsion of Louis Philippe
  shook all Europe, Metternich found it impossible any longer to guide the
  helm of the State, and the Government was compelled to admit a free press
  and the right of citizens to arms. Apart from the popular attitude in
  Italy and in Hungary, where the Diet declared itself permanent under the
  presidency of Kossuth, the insurrection made equal progress in Vienna
  itself, and the royal family, no longer in safety, removed to Innsbruck.
  After various ministerial changes the Emperor abdicated in favour of his
  nephew, Francis Joseph; more vigorous measures were adopted; and Austria,
  aided by Russia, reduced Hungary to submission.</p>

  <p>The year 1855 is memorable for the Concordat with the Pope, which put
  the educational and ecclesiastical affairs of the Empire entirely into
  the hands of the Papal see. In 1859 the hostile intentions of France and
  Sardinia against the possessions of Austria in Italy became so evident
  that she declared war by sending an army across the Ticino; but after
  disastrous defeats at Magenta and Solferino she was compelled to cede
  Milan and the north-west portion of Lombardy to Sardinia. In 1864 she
  joined with the German States in the war against Denmark, but a dispute
  about Schleswig-Holstein involved her in a war with her allies (1866),
  while at the same time Italy renewed her attempts for the recovery of
  Venice. The Italians were defeated at Custozza and driven back across the
  Mincio; but the Prussians, victorious at Königgrätz (or Sadowa),
  threatened Vienna. Peace was concluded with Prussia on 23rd Aug. and with
  Italy on 3rd Oct., the result of the war being the cession of Venetia
  through France to Italy and the withdrawal of Austria from all
  interference in the affairs of Germany.</p>

  <p>For nearly half a century (from 1866 to 1914) the internal affairs of
  Austria-Hungary gave much occupation to statesmen of the dual monarchy.
  Hungarian demands for self-government were finally agreed to, and the
  Empire was divided into the two parts already mentioned&mdash;Austria and
  Hungary. This settlement was consummated by the coronation of the Emperor
  Francis Joseph I, at Budapest, as King of Hungary, on 8th June, 1867. In
  the same year the Concordat of 1855 came up for discussion, <!-- Page 327
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page327"></a>[327]</span>and measures
  were passed for the re-establishment of civil marriage, the emancipation
  of schools from the domination of the Church, and the placing of
  different creeds on a footing of equality. The fact of the
  Austro-Hungarian dominions comprising so many different nationalities
  gave the central Government much trouble, both in regard to internal and
  to external affairs. In regard to the 'Eastern Question', for instance,
  the action of Austria was hampered by the sympathies shown by the Magyars
  for their blood relations, the Turks, while the Slavs were naturally more
  favourable to Russia. During the war between Russia and Turkey in 1877-8
  Austria remained neutral; but at its close it was decided at the Congress
  of Berlin that Bosnia and Herzegovina should in future be administered by
  Austria instead of Turkey. In 1908, taking advantage of the condition of
  Turkey, Austria formally annexed these provinces. By the middle of Oct.,
  1918, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy began to break up into independent
  national States. Four States of some size laid claim to independence,
  viz. German-Austria, Czecho-Slovakia (recognized by the Allies), Hungary,
  and Yugo-Slavia. On 13th Oct., 1921, German Austria signed with Hungary
  the Burgenland pact, agreeing to a plebiscite in several districts. For
  recent history of Austria, see <i>Francis Joseph; European

  <p><b>Autobiog´raphy</b>, a department of literature of which, as a
  definite branch or form at least, we have no very ancient examples,
  though many autobiographical details are contained, for instance, in
  Cicero's and Pliny's letters, while St. Augustine has left a fragmentary
  autobiography in his <i>Confessions</i>. Various writers of note, without
  claiming or perhaps intending to write a formal autobiography, have left
  similar materials in the form of their own memoirs or reminiscences, or,
  for a portion of their lives, in diaries. The chief English diarists are
  Pepys and Evelyn, while Crabb Robinson is an admirable modern example.
  Brief autobiographies were written by Gibbon, Hume, and Sir Walter Scott
  (of his early life only), and among other writers who have given us
  autobiographies or kindred works are Fanny Burney, Cobbett, Haydon, Miss
  Mitford, Harriet Martineau, Leigh Hunt, Hugh Miller (in <i>My Schools and
  Schoolmasters</i>), John Stuart Mill, Anthony Trollope, Sir Henry Taylor,
  Miss F.&nbsp;P. Cobbe, Carlyle, Ruskin, Herbert Spencer, Alexander Bain, and
  Alfred Russel Wallace. Lord Roberts's <i>Forty-one Years in India</i> and
  General Grant's <i>Personal Memoirs</i> are most interesting
  autobiographical works by men of action. One of the most famous of
  autobiographies is that of the Italian Benvenuto Cellini. See

  liquids can be carried out, under pressure, at temperatures considerably
  higher than their normal boiling-points. The vessels may be of copper,
  iron, or other suitable material, are sometimes enamelled within, or may
  have renewable refractory linings when used for corrosive liquids. Some
  types have mechanical agitators. Used in the manufacture of candles,

  <p><b>Au´tograph,</b> a person's own handwriting; an original manuscript
  or signature, as opposed to a copy. The practice of collecting autographs
  or signatures originated in Germany and the Low Countries, chiefly among

  century. Among the earliest collections known are those of John Cotton
  and Hans Sloane in the British Museum, and of Philippe de Bethune,
  brother of Sully, and Loménie de Brienne at the Bibliothèque Nationale.
  The most celebrated collection formed in England in recent years is that
  of Alfred Morrison.</p>

  <p><b>Au´totype</b>, a species of photographic print. A thin sheet of
  gelatine on paper is rendered sensitive to light by treatment with
  bichromate of potash, and then exposed under an ordinary photographic
  negative. The portions of gelatine affected by the light become
  insoluble, the remainder of the gelatine is then washed away, and the
  picture remains reproduced in the gelatine, there being slight elevations
  and depressions corresponding with the distribution of light and shade.
  This may be printed from, but it is more often made use of to obtain
  electrotypes or other reverses, from which impressions can more easily be
  taken.</p>

  Dordogne, contain the highest points of Central France: Mount Dor, 6188
  feet; Cantal, 6093 feet, and Puy-de-Dôme, 4806 feet. The number of

  of 1326 ordains the repetition of the prayer thrice each morning, noon,
  and evening, the hour being indicated by sound of bells called the Ave
  Maria or Angelus Domini. The prayers are counted upon the small beads of

  property lost. A policy of insurance generally covers both general and
  particular average, unless specially excepted.&mdash;<i>Averaging</i>, in

  Italy, between the ancient Cumæ and Puteoli, about 8 miles from Naples.
  It is the crater of an old volcano, and is in some places 180 feet deep.
  Formerly the gloom of its forest surroundings and its mephitic
  exhalations caused it to be regarded as the entrance to the infernal
  regions. It was the fabled abode of the Cimmerians, and especially
  dedicated to Proserpine.</p>

  <p><b>Averroes</b> (a-ver´o-es; corrupted from <b>Ibn Roshd</b>), the
  most renowned Arabian philosopher, born at Cordova, in Spain, 1126, died
  at Morocco 1198. His ability procured him the succession to his father's
  office of chief magistrate, and the King of Morocco appointed him at the
  same time cadi in the province of Mauretania. Accused of being an
  infidel, he was, however, deprived of his offices, and banished to Spain;
  but, being persecuted there also, he fled to Fez, where he was condemned
  to recant and undergo public penance. Upon this he went back to his own
  country, where the Caliph Almansur finally restored him to his dignities.
  Averroes regarded Aristotle as the greatest of all philosophers, and
  devoted himself so largely to the exposition of his works as to be called
  among the Arabians <i>The Interpreter</i>. He wrote a compendium of
  medicine, and treatises on theology, philosophy, jurisprudence, &amp;c.
  His commentaries upon <!-- Page 330 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page330"></a>[330]</span>Aristotle appeared before 1250 in a Latin
  translation attributed to Michael Scott, the reputed wizard (1194-1250),

  physician, born at Kharmaithen, in the province of Bokhara, <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 980. After practising as a physician he quitted
  Bokhara at the age of twenty-two, and for a number of years led a
  wandering life, settling at last at Hamadan, subsequently as vizier of
  the Emir. On the death of his patron he lived in retirement at Hamadan,
  but having secretly offered his services to the Sultan of Ispahan he was
  imprisoned by the new Emir. Escaping, he fled to Ispahan, was received
  with great honour by the Sultan, and passed there in quietness the last
  fourteen years of his life, writing upon medicine, logic, metaphysics,
  astronomy, and geometry. His philosophy was Aristotelianism mingled with
  neo-Platonism, and his influence is most marked in Dante and the Mystics.
  He died at Hamadan, in Northern Persia, 1037, leaving many writings,
  mostly commentaries on Aristotle. Of his 100 treatises the best known is
  the <i>Canon Medicinæ</i>, which was still in use as a textbook at
  Louvain and Montpellier in the middle of the seventeenth century. His
  <i>Philosophia Orientalis</i>, mentioned by Roger Bacon, is lost.</p>

  The industries of the city are numerous and varied, the principal being
  connected with silk. The silk manufacture and the breeding of silk-worms
  are the principal employments in the district. Here Petrarch lived
  several years, and made the acquaintance of Laura, whose tomb is in the
  Franciscan church. From 1309 to 1377 seven Popes in succession, from
  Clement V to Gregory XI, resided in this city. After its purchase by Pope

  each side of the neck. It reproduces by laying eggs, and was for some
  time regarded as a perfect animal with permanent gills. It is said,
  however, that they frequently lose their gills like the other members of
  the genus, though some authorities maintain that the true axolotl never
  loses its gills, and that merely confusion with <i>A. tigr&#x12B;num</i>
  has led to the belief, as this species sometimes retains its branchiæ,

  and the Parliament which confirmed Robert Bruce's title to the crown sat
  in Ayr. It is picturesquely situated, and has excellent public and other
  buildings. Two bridges connect Ayr proper with the suburbs of Newton and
  Wallacetown, a third stands farther up the river. The 'New Brig' of
  Burns's 'Brigs of Ayr' (built in 1788) had to be replaced by a new
  structure in 1879, while the 'Auld Brig' (built in 1252) still stands,
  after being repaired. Carpets, lace goods, leather, iron goods, &amp;c.,
  are manufactured. The harbour accommodation is good, and in particular
  coals are largely exported. The house in which Burns was born stands
  within 1½ miles of the town, and near 'Alloway's auld haunted kirk', and
  a monument to him is near. Ayr unites with Ardrossan, Irvine, Prestwick,
  Saltcoats, and Troon in sending a member to Parliament. Pop.

  the districts of Carrick in the south, Kyle in the middle, and Cunningham
  in the north. The surface is irregular, and a large portion of it hilly,
  but much of it is fertile. The principal streams are the Ayr, Stinchar,
  Girvan, Doon, Irvine, and Garnock. Coal and iron are abundant; and there
  are numerous collieries and ironworks. Limestone and freestone are also
  abundant. Agriculture is in a flourishing state, the principal crops
  being oats, turnips, and early potatoes, while dairy husbandry is
  extensively practised; the Ayrshire cows, referred to in the eighteenth
  century as the Cunningham, are celebrated as milkers, and Ayrshire cheese
  ('Dunlop' and 'Cheddar') has a high reputation. Woollen manufactures are
  extensive, particularly carpets and bonnets; lace goods are largely made;
  Kilmarnock is a centre of engineering and of dairying education. Goods
  made include explosives, boots and shoes, chemicals, and leather. Chief

  some reputation in Rome as a painter, he married the daughter of Manzoni,
  and achieved success in literature by his novels <i>Ettore Fieramosca</i>
  (1833) and <i>Niccolo dei Lapi</i> (1841). These embodied much of the
  patriotic spirit, and in a short time he devoted himself exclusively to
  fostering the national sentiment by personal action and by his writings.
  Many of the reforms of Pius IX were due to him. He commanded a legion in
  the Italian struggle of 1848, and was severely wounded at Vincenza.

  <p><b>Azo Compounds</b>, a class of substances which belong to the
  benzene series and contain carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen. All azo
  compounds are highly coloured, and in some cases they are direct cotton
  dyes. The simplest azo compound is <i>azobenzene</i>, the chemical
  formula of which is
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>&mdash;N&nbsp;=&nbsp;N&mdash;C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>.
  It is prepared from nitrobenzene by reducing it with stannous chloride
  and sodium hydroxide. Azobenzene is <!-- Page 335 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page335"></a>[335]</span>a highly-coloured
  crystalline substance, but it is not a dye; it forms, however, the basis
  of the dyes known as <i>azodyes</i>. The azodyes form one of the largest
  groups of dyes, and derive their name from the presence of the
  characteristic chemical group &mdash;N&nbsp;=&nbsp;N&mdash;, known as the
  <i>azo</i> group. Azo compounds may become exceedingly complicated in
  structure. They are divided into mon-azo, di-azo, tri-azo compounds
  according to the number of azo groups present. The well-known dyes Congo
  Red and Bismarck Brown are azo compounds of complicated structure. Azo
  dyes were discovered by Griess in 1856, but as a class did not come on
  the market until about 1876.</p>

  Graciosa; and a <span class="scac">S.E.</span>, consisting of São Miguel
  (or St. Michael) and Santa Maria. The total area is 922 sq. miles; São
  Miguel (containing the capital Ponta Delgada), Pico, and Terceira are the
  largest. The islands, which are volcanic and subject to earthquakes, are
  of comparatively recent origin, and are conical, lofty, precipitous, and
  picturesque. The most remarkable summit is the peak of Pico, about 7600
  feet high. There are numerous hot springs. They are covered with
  luxuriant vegetation, and diversified with woods, corn-fields, vineyards,
  lemon and orange groves, and rich, open pastures. The mild and somewhat
  humid climate, combined with the natural fertility of the soil, brings
  all kinds of vegetable products rapidly to perfection, among the most
  important being grain, oranges, pine-apples, bananas, potatoes, yams,
  beans, coffee, and tobacco. The inhabitants are mainly of Portuguese
  descent, indolent and devoid of enterprise. Principal exports: wine and
  brandy, oranges, maize, beans, pineapples, cattle. The climate is
  recommended as suitable for consumptive patients. The Azores were
  discovered by Cabral about 1431, shortly after which date they were taken
  possession of and colonized by the Portuguese. When first visited they
  were uninhabited, and had scarcely any other animals except birds,
  particularly hawks, to which, called in Portuguese <i>açores</i>, the
  islands owe their name. Pop. 242,613 (1911).</p>

  <p><b>Az´tecs</b> (from <i>Aztatl</i> (heron), and <i>Flacatl</i> (man),
  'people of the heron'), a race of people who settled in Mexico early in
  the fourteenth century, ultimately extended their dominion over a large
  territory, and were still extending their supremacy at the time of the
  arrival of the Spaniards, by whom they were speedily subjugated. Their
  political organization, termed by the Spanish writers an absolute
  monarchy, consisted of a military chief exercising important, but not
  unlimited, power in civil affairs, in which the council of chiefs and
  periodic assemblies of the judges had also a voice. Their most celebrated
  ruler was Montezuma, who was reigning when the Spaniards arrived, about
  the middle of the fifteenth century. It is inferred that considerable
  numbers of them lived in large communal residences, and that land was
  held and cultivated upon the communal principle. Slavery and polygamy
  were both legitimate, but the children of slaves were regarded as free.
  Although ignorant of the horse, ox, &amp;c., they had a considerable
  knowledge of agriculture, maize and the agave being the chief produce.
  Silver, lead, tin, and copper were obtained from mines, and gold from the
  surface and river beds, but iron was unknown to them, their tools being
  of bronze and obsidian. Metal coins were not in use. In metal-work,
  feather-work, weaving, and pottery they possessed a high degree of skill.
  To record events they used picture-writing, and their lunar calendars
  were of unusual accuracy. Two <!-- Page 336 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page336"></a>[336]</span>special deities claimed their reverence:
  Huitzilo-pochtli, the god of war, propitiated with human sacrifices; and
  Quetzalcoatl, the beneficent god of light and air, with whom at first the
  Aztecs were disposed to identify Cortez. Their temples, with large
  terraced pyramidal bases, were in the charge of an exceedingly large
  priesthood, to whom the education of the young was entrusted. As a
  civilization of apparently independent origin, yet closely resembling in
  many features the archaic Oriental civilizations, the Aztec civilization
  is of the first interest, but in most accounts of it a large speculative
  element has to be discounted.</p>

  <p><b>Ba´al</b>, or <b>Bel</b>, a Semitic word, which primarily signified
  lord or proprietor, and was afterwards applied to many different
  divinities, or, with qualifying epithets, to the same divinity regarded
  in different aspects, describing him as an occupier of some physical
  object or locality, or as a possessor of some attribute. Thus in
  <i>Hos.</i> ii, 16 it is applied to Jehovah himself, while
  <i>Baal-berith</i> (the Covenant-lord) was the god of the Shechemites,
  and <i>Baal-zebub</i> (the Fly-god) the idol of the Philistines at Ekron.
  Baal was the sacred title applied to the Sun as the principal male deity
  of the Ph&oelig;nicians and their descendants, the Carthaginians, as well
  as of the ancient Canaanitish nations, and was worshipped as the supreme
  ruler and vivifier of nature. The word enters into the composition of
  many Hebrew, Ph&oelig;nician, and Carthaginian names of persons and
  places; thus, <i>Jerubaal</i>, <i>Hasdrubal</i> (help of Baal),
  <i>Hannibal</i> (grace of Baal), and <i>Baal-Hammon</i>,

  is the Temple of the Sun, built either by Antoninus Pius or by Septimius
  Severus. Some of the blocks used in its construction are 60 feet long by
  12 thick; and its fifty-four columns, of which six are still standing,
  were 72 feet high and 22 in circumference. Near it is a temple of
  Jupiter, of smaller size though larger than the Parthenon at Athens, and
  there are other structures of an elaborately ornate type. Originally a
  centre of Sun-worship, it became a Roman colony under Julius Cæsar, was
  garrisoned by Augustus, and acquired increasing renown under Trajan as
  the seat of an oracle. Under Constantine its temples became churches, but
  after being sacked by the Arabs in 748, and more completely pillaged by
  Tamerlane in 1401, it sank into hopeless decay. The work of destruction
  was completed by an earthquake in 1759.</p>

  eleven years, but delivered no lectures. As early as 1812 he conceived
  the idea of calculating numerical tables by machinery, and in 1823 he
  received a grant from Government for the construction of such a machine.
  After a series of experiments lasting eight years, and an expenditure of
  £17,000 <!-- Page 337 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  of a much more enlarged work, an analytical engine, worked with cards
  like the jacquard-loom; but the project was never completed. The
  incompleted machine is now in the South Kensington Museum. Among the many

  'consolation of the eyes', who perished with many others during a
  persecution in 1852. The Bab himself had been executed about two years
  before this, and was succeeded by a noble youth, Mirza Yahya. The sect
  holds that all individual existence is an emanation from the supreme
  deity, by whom it will be ultimately reabsorbed. The morality of the sect
  is pure and cheerful, and it shows great advancement in the treatment of
  woman. Moses, Christ, and Mohammed are acknowledged as prophets, though
  only mere precursors of the Bab. A schism divided the followers of Babism
  into two sects, Bahais and Ezelis. The former have carried on an active
  propaganda in America.</p>

  Cynoceph&#x103;lus and Papio. They have elongated abrupt muzzles like a
  dog, strong tusks or canine teeth, usually short tails, cheek-pouches,
  small deep eyes with large eyebrows, and naked callosities on the
  buttocks. Their hind and fore feet are well proportioned, so that they
  run easily on all fours, but they do not maintain themselves in an
  upright posture with facility. They are generally of the size of a
  moderately large dog, but the largest, the mandrill, is, when erect,
  nearly of the height of a man. They are almost all African, ugly, sullen,
  fierce, lascivious, and gregarious, defending themselves by throwing
  stones, dirt, &amp;c. They live on fruits and roots, eggs and insects.
  They include the chacma, drill, common baboon, and mandrill. The chacma
  or pig-tailed baboon (<i>Cynoceph&#x103;lus porcarius</i>) is found in
  considerable numbers in parts of the S. African colonies, where the
  inhabitants wage war against them on account of the ravages they commit
  in the fields and gardens. The common baboon (<i>C. babouin</i>) inhabits
  a large part of Africa farther to the north. It is of a brownish-yellow
  colour, while the chacma is greyish-black, or in parts black. The
  hamadryas (<i>C. hamadryas</i>) of Abyssinia is characterized by long
  hair, forming a sort of shoulder-cape. The black baboon (<i>C. niger</i>)

  <p><b>Baby-farming.</b> The law relating to the protection of children
  and young persons has been subjected to amendment and consolidation by
  the Children Act of 1908, which wholly repealed the Infant Life
  Protection Act of 1897 dealing with baby-farming and infant life
  protection.</p>

  <p>The Act of 1908 (Part I) deals with baby-farming, and requires that
  notice shall be given to the Local Authority (in Scotland the Parish
  Council) by the person undertaking for reward the nursing and maintenance
  of any infant or infants under seven years of age apart from their
  parents, within forty-eight hours after reception, unless the period for
  which it is received be only forty-eight hours or less. The notice
  requires the name, sex, date and place of birth of the child to be
  stated, where it is to be kept, and from whom it is received. The Act
  also provides that such a person shall notify any change in his residence
  or the removal or death of the infant to the Local Authority within
  forty-eight hours. In regard to all these matters the Act is
  retrospective, and necessitates persons who had undertaken nursing and
  maintenance of such infants before its coming into operation to comply
  with its provisions within a month after the commencement thereof. But it
  exempts any person who may have given the similar notice required by the
  Infant Life Protection Act of 1897, although it does not exempt any
  person whose duty it was to have given notice thereunder from any
  liability which such a person may have incurred thereunder.</p>

  <p>A duty is imposed upon Local Authorities to inquire regarding persons
  willing to undertake the nursing and maintenance of infants, to appoint
  infant-protection visitors of either sex in so far as it provides for
  infant life protection and gives powers to such Local Authorities and
  visitors for fulfilling the requirements of the Act. It is an offence for
  the person undertaking the nursing to refuse to allow such visitors
  access to the infant or the premises in which it is kept; and, if need
  be, application may be made to the court for a warrant to enter the house
  in which an infant is farmed out, and where there is reason to believe
  that the Act is being contravened. It is an offence for any infant to be
  kept (1) by any person from whose care an infant has been removed under
  the Act or the Infant Life Protection Act, or (2) by any person convicted
  of any offence under Part II of the Children Act of 1908 or the
  Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act, 1904.</p>

  <p>The Local Authority may fix the number of infants under the age of
  seven years which may be kept in any dwelling, and it is an offence to
  keep more. Provision is also made for the removal of an infant from
  overcrowded, dangerous, or insanitary premises, or from the custody of a
  person unfit to take charge of the child; and an application may be made
  by a visitor to a magistrate for a removal order enforceable by the
  visitor or a constable. Should the infant die, notice of the fact must be
  given by the person with whom it is farmed out to the Procurator-fiscal
  of the district, if in Scotland, and, if in England, to the Coroner of
  the district, within twenty-four hours. He shall hold an inquest unless a
  certificate by a medical practitioner specifying the cause of death shall
  be forwarded. Failure to give such notice is punishable under the
  Act.</p>

  <p>A person nursing an infant for reward shall have no interest in the
  life of the child for the purposes of life assurance. It is not
  permissible for such a person or insurance company to insure the life of
  such a child. To do so renders both <!-- Page 339 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page339"></a>[339]</span>the person and the
  insurance company liable to prosecution.</p>

  <p>Any person knowingly or wilfully making any false statement in any
  notice required to be given under the Act commits an offence under the
  Act.</p>

  <p>Imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or a fine not
  exceeding £25, may be imposed upon any person found guilty upon summary
  conviction of an offence against Part I of the Children Act, 1908; in
  addition the court may order the removal of the infant to a place of
  safety. All fines are payable to the Local Authority for the purposes of
  the Act.</p>

  <p>Legal guardians of an infant, as well as institutions established for
  the protection and care of infants, are exempted from the provisions of
  Part I of the Children Act, 1908.</p>

  <p><b>Bab´ylon</b>, the capital of Babylonia, on the left of the
  Euphrates, one of the largest and most splendid cities of the ancient
  world, now a scene of ruins, and earth-mounds containing them. Babylon
  was a royal city sixteen hundred years before the Christian era; but the
  old city was almost entirely destroyed in 683 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> A new city was built by Nebuchadnezzar nearly a
  century later. This was in the form of a square, each side 15 miles long,
  with walls of such immense height and thickness as to constitute one of
  the wonders of the world. It contained splendid edifices, large gardens
  and pleasure-grounds, especially the 'hanging-gardens', a sort of lofty
  terraced structure supporting earth enough for trees to grow, and the
  celebrated Tower of Babel or Temple of Belus, rising by stages to the
  height of 625 feet. (See <i>Babel, Tower of</i>.) After the city was
  taken by Cyrus in 538 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, and Babylonia made
  a Persian province, it began to decline, and had suffered severely by the
  time of Alexander the Great. He intended to restore it, but was prevented
  by his death, which took place here in 323 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, from which time its decay was rapid.
  Interesting discoveries have been made on its site, more especially of
  numerous and valuable inscriptions in the cuneiform or arrow-head
  character. The modern town of Hillah is believed to represent the ancient
  city, and the plain here for miles round is studded with vast mounds of
  earth and brick and imposing ruins. The greatest mound is Birs Nimrud,
  about 6 miles from Hillah. It rises nearly 200 feet, is crowned by a
  ruined tower, and is commonly believed to be the remains of the ancient
  Temple of Belus. Another great ruin-mound, called Mujellibeh, has also
  been assigned as its site.</p>

  <p><b>Babylonia and Assyria.</b> These ancient seats of Mesopotamian
  civilization lay across the western Asian trade-routes, Babylonia being
  in the south and Assyria in the north. The area, in which they flourished
  is embraced by the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, and extends from the head
  of the Persian Gulf to the frontiers of Armenia and Northern Syria, is
  bordered on the east by Persia and on the west by the Syro-Arabian
  desert. 'Mesopotamia' is a term borrowed by the ancient Greeks from the
  Semites, and was first applied to the north-western region. There was a
  Roman province of that name. The northern area of the Tigro-Euphrates
  valley is partly mountainous and partly steppe land, with wide stretches
  of elevated grazing-lands and fertile districts on the banks of rivers.
  Assyria, derived from A-usar ('the river-bank region'), had origin in
  north-eastern Mesopotamia. Its most ancient capital, Asshur (modern
  Kal'at Sherkat), was situated on the western bank of the River Tigris,
  between the tributaries the Upper Zab and the Lower Zab. Nineveh, the
  last capital of all, lay farther north on the eastern bank of the Tigris,
  and right opposite modern Mosul. The Assyrians called themselves
  Asshurai, and their national god was Ashur (earlier Ashir), written
  A-Shur, but confused in time with Ash-Shur, the name of the capital. The
  southern area of Mesopotamia, below Bagdad, where the Tigris and
  Euphrates come within 35 miles of one another, is a flat alluvial plain.
  Babylonia proper is that fish-shaped region between the rivers, which
  broadens out to about 100 miles and gradually narrows to the point at
  Kurnah where the rivers meet and form the Shatt-el-Arab. From Kurnah to
  the head of the Persian Gulf is the ancient area of Chaldea, which means
  'Sea-land'. The inhabitants called themselves Kaldu (Sea-landers) and
  were known to the Hebrews as the Kasdim, and to the Greeks as the
  Chaldaioi. Babylonia, and the rest of the alluvial plain, is the 'gift'
  of the rivers which rise in flood each year when the snow melts on the
  Armenian mountains. Both the Tigris and the Euphrates bring down enormous
  quantities of sediment&mdash;indeed five times as much as does the
  Egyptian Nile&mdash;and they have withal more destructive tendencies. The
  accumulating silt tends to divert the flow of the rivers in the south,
  and a process of land-making which began at the close of the Ice Age is
  still in progress, thrusting back the head of the Persian Gulf. At one
  time the Tigris and Euphrates entered the gulf by separate mouths, and
  Chaldea was then a narrow fringe of steppe land, plain, and marshes. The
  River Tigris is about 1146 miles long, and begins to rise early in March,
  reaching its height in May, and subsiding before the end of June. The
  Euphrates is a slower river, about 1780 miles in length. It begins to
  rise a fortnight later than the Tigris, is longer in flood, and does not
  reach its lowest level until September. As there is a drop of only <!--
  Page 340 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page340"></a>[340]</span>120
  feet between Bagdad and the sea, a distance, as the crow flies, of about
  300 miles, the ancient Babylonians did their utmost to conserve the water
  which came down in such abundance and was rapidly drained away, after
  doing much damage. Near Bagdad the Tigris is on a higher level than the
  Euphrates, and could be run into it through a canal; farther south the
  Euphrates, being on the higher level, could be run by canal into the
  Tigris. The ancient engineers cut these and other canals; indeed, they
  covered the whole valley with a network of them. To store the Euphrates
  water for the season of drought and great heat, they formed canals which
  carried the roaring flood into two depressions in the western desert
  between the modern towns of Kerbela and Rama<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>di. These depressions are utilized for
  the British irrigation scheme. The Babylonians did their utmost to
  control the Tigris by erecting earthen dams so as to hold up as much of
  the water as possible. Earthen dykes were also erected to raise its
  banks. The right bank protected the farms from disastrous flooding. These
  ancient irrigation works made Babylonia the greatest grain-yielding area
  in the ancient world. Its vast surplus of food stimulated trade and
  brought Babylonia immense wealth, while its strategic situation made it
  very powerful. Its cultural influence flowed along the trade routes,
  eastward across Persia and the Iranian plateau, northward through Assyria
  to Armenia (ancient Urartu) and beyond, and north-westward along the
  Euphrates banks into Syria and Palestine, and into Asia Minor, the land
  of the Hittites, and then along the highway to Europe, called later by
  the Persians 'the royal road'. The road to Egypt ran southward from North
  Syria through Palestine, skirting the maritime valley by 'the way of the
  Philistines'. The merchants of many nations met in the city of Babylon,
  the London of the ancient western Asian world, and in the trading centres
  of North Syria, including Carchemish.</p>

  <p>The earliest agriculturists and traders of Babylonia were the
  Sumerians, a non-Semitic people, who built a number of cities in the
  irrigated valley and founded colonies in Assyria. No trace has been found
  of a Neolithic Age in Babylonia. Its civilization, so far as our
  knowledge goes, began after copper was introduced. At an early period
  Semites filtered into the valley. They absorbed Sumerian civilization,
  and ultimately became politically predominant in the northern part of the
  valley, which was called Akkad (the biblical Accad). The southern part
  was then known as Sumer or Sumeria (the biblical 'Plain of Shinar').
  Akkad embraced the city States of Agade, Babylon, Borsippa, Sippar, Kish,
  Opis, and Kutha. The Sumerian city States included Eridu, Ur (later 'of
  the Chaldees' and the birthplace of Abraham), Lagash, Shuruppak, Erech,
  Umma, and Adab. Inter-state wars resulted time and again in the formation
  of confederacies which were more of political than racial character, and
  the predominance of one city or another. Religious ideas were fused, and
  local pantheons appear to have reflected local politics. The chief seat
  of early Sumerian civilization was the city of Eridu, a name signifying
  'on the seashore'. Its site is marked by modern Abu-Shahrein on the
  eastern bank of the Euphrates, and south-east of Ur, modern Mukayyar.
  Eridu was originally a seaport on the Persian Gulf, from which it is now
  separated by about 125 miles of land formed by river silt. The chief god
  of Eridu was Ea, a name also rendered Ae and Aa, and apparently meaning
  'waters' or 'house (region) of waters'. That the term 'waters' had a
  special significance for the inhabitants of a water-formed land is
  evident by the fact that the Semitic equivalent of Ea is Enki, which
  means 'lord of earth'. Other titles of the god were 'lord of Heaven and
  Earth', 'ruler of the land', 'the deep', 'god of the abyss', and 'king of
  the river'. He was withal the 'Creator', water having created Sumeria,
  and Nadimmud, 'lord of everything', as the Egyptian Osiris in his
  character of god of the Nile was 'Neb-er-Zer', also 'lord of everything'.
  Ea had a ship with a crew including his son Marduk (Merodach or Marad,
  the Ni-marad or Nimrod of legend) and In-ab, 'the pilot of Eridu'. The
  ship was hailed, in religious literature, as the bringer of fertility and
  joy. Evidently the beginning of Sumerian civilization had some connection
  with ancient seafarers. Of special interest in this connection are the
  references made by the Greek writer Berosus to Oannes, a sea-dweller who
  came daily from the Persian Gulf to instruct the early <!-- Page 341
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page341"></a>[341]</span>Babylonians
  how to irrigate the land, grow crops, erect houses, make laws, write,
  calculate and measure, and engage in trade. Texts have been discovered
  which tend to identify Oannes with the god Ea. As the early Sumerians
  bore a strong physical resemblance to the ancient Egyptians, and there
  were links between the early religious beliefs and customs of the two
  peoples, it is suspected that they represented two branches of the same
  ancient stock. Some think Sumerian civilization was founded by colonists
  from Egypt, while others believe that Egyptian civilization was
  stimulated by settlers from Sumeria. The question as to who first
  invented ships has an important bearing in this connection. When we turn
  to Sumero-Babylonian religious myths we find that some reflect local
  natural phenomena. In one the Euphrates is hailed as the River (god) "who
  didst create all things". Another, referring to the creation of man, says
  that Marduk (earlier the god Gilimma) "tied reeds on the face of the
  waters, he formed dust and poured it out beside the reeds ... he formed
  mankind". Another version is that man was created from the god's blood
  and bone, or, as Berosus has it, from the god's blood and earth. The
  oldest Sumerian creation myth states that all things came from primeval
  water. Then many deities were created by the pre-existing triad of gods,
  Anu (the sky-god), Enlil ('the elder Bel', the earth-god, and 'lord of
  grain'), and Ea, who was associated with the goddess Ninkharsagga. Ea had
  several other wives, including Ninshar or Ninkurra, Ninella, Nintu, and
  Damkina. These goddesses were ultimately all absorbed by Ishtar, the
  Semitic name of the love and mother goddess. In the later Babylonian
  'Seven Tablets' version of the creation myth a conflict is introduced.
  The female chaos-dragon Tiamat is slain by Marduk, the chief god of
  Babylon, 'the later Bel', who cuts up her body and uses part to form the
  sky and part to keep the waters in their place. After a time a deluge
  took place. In the Sumerian myth a priest-king called Ziusudu (earlier
  named Tatug or Uttu) corresponds both to Adam and to Noah, and builds a
  large vessel, having been warned by Ea of the approaching disaster. The
  Gilgamesh Epic refers to the hero as Ut-na-pishtim (or Pir-na-pishtim).
  He and his wife afterwards become immortal, and they are visited on their
  island by Gilgamesh (the Babylonian Hercules), when, smitten by disease,
  he searches for the Plant of Life, which he finds and afterwards loses.
  Ishtar, the goddess who plays a part in this epic, is also the heroine of
  the poetic legend which tells of her descent to Hades in quest of Tammuz,
  whose story resembles somewhat that of Adonis and has Osirian
  characteristics. The Babylonian Persephone was Eresh-ki-gal with whom
  Tammuz dwelt in her underworld for part of the year. Associated with her
  was Nergal, chief god of Kutha, whose planet was Mars. He conquered
  Hades. He and other city gods appear to have been developed from
  attributes vaguely shared by the earlier triad Anu, Bel-Enlil, and Ea.
  The moon-god of Ur was Sin (Sumerian Nannara), whose name clings to the
  desert of Sinai. Shamash was the Semitic name of the sun-god of Sippar,
  the Sumerian being Utu; Gishnu, the Light, and Ma-banda-anna, 'the boat
  of heaven' (like the Egyptian Ra), and Mitra were among his other
  non-Semitic names. Dagan, the god of the Euphrates, is regarded as a form
  of Ea, and as probably the same deity as Dagon of the Philistines. In
  later times the astrologers coloured with their doctrines the religious
  beliefs of Babylonia.</p>

  <p>Among the early empire-builders of Babylonia were Lugal-zaggisi of
  Sumerian Erech, who claimed to have subdued all lands from the Lower Sea
  (Persian Gulf) to the Upper Sea (the Mediterranean). He flourished about
  2800 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> Another was Sargon of Akkad, who
  lived about a century and a half later. He must not be confused with the
  much later biblical Sargon of Assyria. His son or grandson, Naram-Sin,
  recorded his great trading activities and victories over his enemies,
  including the Elamites, whose chief stronghold was Susa in south-western
  Persia. Elam was a rival power of considerable strength. About 2200 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> it had overrun a great part of Sumeria, and
  Akkad fell to the invading bands of Amorites. These Amorites founded the
  Hammurabi Dynasty, of which the king of that name was sixth in
  succession; Hammurabi extinguished the last sparks of Elamite power in
  Sumeria, which, with Akkad, was united to form the kingdom of Babylonia,
  named after Babylon, the capital. It was during this period that Abraham
  migrated from Ur to Palestine. Hammurabi (<i>c.</i> 2123-2081 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>) codified the ancient Sumerian laws and did much
  to develop trade. The chief god of his kingdom was Marduk, 'the later
  Bel', whose temple was called Esagilla. Babylon became the greatest
  trading centre in Western Asia and a rival of the Egyptian Memphis.
  Sumerian gradually ceased to be a spoken language, being supplanted by
  Semitic, but remained, like Latin, in mediæval Europe, the language of
  law, culture, and religion, while the Babylonian language became the
  language of trade and diplomacy, and was used in international
  correspondence by all the great Powers. The Hammurabi dynasty came to an
  end about 1926 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, when the Hittites raided
  Babylonia and carried off the statues of Marduk and his consort.
  Kassites, assisted by Elamites, had been attacking <!-- Page 342 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page342"></a>[342]</span>Babylonia from the
  east, and the Sea-landers, who were Arabians mixed with Sumerians,
  established their independence. In the end the Kassites, who were
  probably Aryan by race, conquered Babylonia and established a new
  dynasty. Like the Trojans they were 'tamers of horses'. Their military
  successes are believed to have been due to the use of the horse, which
  was a rarity in Babylonia before their time, but became common as a beast
  of burden as soon as the Kassite dynasty was established. Kassite
  supremacy lasted for over 570 years, and during that period Babylonia was
  known as Karduniash. One of its early kings brought back from Khani
  (Mitanni) the statues of Marduk and his consort which had been carried
  off by the Hittites. Babylonian civilization was not changed by Kassite
  conquest, and its trade went on as of yore. The Kassites formed an
  aristocracy like the Normans in England. During the Kassite period
  Assyria was a growing power. It had origin as a Sumerian colony, but
  above the relics of the Sumerians at Asshur have been found those of a
  people whose kings had such non-Semitic and probably Aryan names as
  Ushpia, Kikia, and Adasi. The Amorites afterwards swept into Assyria,
  which they Semitized. During the Hammurabi dynasty it was subject to
  Babylonian overlordship. It grew independent during the latter period of
  the Kassite dynasty, and its kings formed compacts with the Kassites.
  Their western neighbours were by this time the Mitannians. An Aryan
  military aristocracy had formed a powerful State in north-western
  Mesopotamia, where they worshipped Indra, Varuna, and Mitra, gods which
  figure in the mythology of the Aryan invaders of India. Egypt, under
  Thothmes III, extended her Syrian empire to the borders of Mitannia and a
  friendship sprang up between the two Powers. Assyria was during the
  period subject to Mitanni. The Tell-el-Amarna letters reveal the fact
  that Egyptian monarchs had married princesses from Mitanni, and the
  famous Akhenaton had Mitannian blood in his veins.</p>

  <p>The Hittites conquered Northern Syria and overran Mitannia when the
  Egyptian Asian empire went to pieces. Assyria then became powerful and
  independent again, the first great king of its new age being
  Ashur-uballit, who was strong enough to interfere with Babylonia's
  domestic politics. Shalmaneser I of Assyria (<i>c.</i> 1300 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>) conquered the whole of the Mitanni kingdom and
  extended the Assyrian empire westward across the Babylonian caravan road
  to North Syria. He built a new capital at Kalah (Nimrud). His son,
  Tulkulti&mdash;Nineb I&mdash;(<i>c.</i> 1275 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>), conquered Babylonia and reigned over it for
  seven years. In the end he was murdered by political conspirators, with
  whom his son was associated. Civil war ensued, and Assyria's history is
  found to be obscure for a century afterwards. In Babylon the Kassite
  dynasty, under which trade flourished, came to an end as a result of an
  Elamite invasion about 1185 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> A new
  Babylonian dynasty then arose, and the third king, Nebuchadnezzar I,
  revived the old empire and waged war against Assyria. But the future lay
  with Assyria, which was organized as a military State. It did not have
  Babylonia's natural resources, and could only exist as a great Power by
  imposing tribute on weaker States. A standing army was the basis of its
  strength. The national god was Ashur, who was symbolized by a winged
  disk, an adaptation of the Egyptian winged disk of Horus. It was carried
  to battle with the king, so that wherever the king was, there was the
  national god of war. The heavily-bearded Assyrians were a fiercer and
  more war-like people than the mild shaven Babylonians, who were ever
  influenced by Sumerian modes of thought. The Assyrian temperament is
  reflected in its art, which at its best is characterized by vigorous
  realism and brilliant ferocity. Much of it is harsh, exaggerated, and
  pompous. A sharp contrast is presented by the calmer and more idealistic
  art of the Sumero-Babylonians. The records of Assyrian monarchs deal
  mainly with extensive conquests. They did their utmost to set up a reign
  of terror in Western Asia, and when subject States revolted the chief men
  in them were flayed alive or impaled on stakes. The wholesale destruction
  of trading city States and the massacres of thousands of innocents were
  fit subjects for an Assyrian conqueror to boast of in his inscriptions.
  Hittites, North Syrians, Babylonians, and Urartians (Armenians), were
  time and again plundered and subjected. A great conqueror of the Middle
  Period was Tiglath-Pileser I (<i>c.</i> 1100 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>), and <!-- Page 343 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page343"></a>[343]</span>other monarchs of the same name repeated
  his conquests and atrocities during the last century of Assyria's
  existence. The military glory of such a monarch as Ashur-natsir-pal III
  (885-860 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), whose armies swept through
  western Asia like cyclones, has a lurid background of savage cruelty and
  oppression. He fought for no greater cause than plunder and the
  maintenance of Assyria's ability to wring tribute from the oppressed. His
  son, Shalmaneser III, extended the empire but died under a cloud of
  internal revolt. Subsequent rulers dominated Babylonia, and one,
  Adad-nirari IV (810-782 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), married the
  Babylonian princess, Sammurammat, the Semiramis of tradition.
  Tiglath-Pileser IV (745-727 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>) was overlord
  of Babylon, and, indeed, Babylonia was more or less under Assyrian sway
  for the next century. Sargon II ('Sargon the later') did his utmost to
  break the national spirit in subject States by transporting whole
  communities from one to another. He removed a portion of the 'ten lost
  tribes' to the Median hills, and dispatched Babylonians from Kutha to
  Samaria, where they made Nergal their chief god. His campaigns extended
  to Ph&oelig;nicia, Cilicia, and Armenia. Sennacherib, his son, defeated
  Egypt and her allies in Palestine and besieged Hezekiah in Jerusalem. A
  revolution in Babylonia broke out, and he swept into it and devastated
  Babylon, so that Nineveh might become the chief city in Mesopotamia. But
  Babylon had to be rebuilt by his son Esarhaddon, so that its dislocated
  trade might be restored. Esarhaddon, recognizing that the great
  commercial rival of Babylonia was Egypt, and that Egypt instigated the
  Palestinian and Syrian revolts against Assyria, invaded the Nile valley
  and captured and sacked Memphis. Ashur-bani-pal (668-626 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>), the next Assyrian emperor, punished the
  Egyptian rebels by sweeping southwards and capturing and sacking Thebes,
  which is referred to as No (Nu-Amon) in the Bible (<i>Nahum</i>, iii,
  8-10): "Populous No ... Yet was she carried away ... her young children
  also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they (the
  Assyrians) cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were
  bound in chains". Egypt became for a time an Assyrian province. Elam was
  similarly dealt with, the great capital Susa being treated like Thebes.
  On the north and east Assyrian power was established with characteristic
  Assyrian ferocity and thoroughness. The result was that the predatory
  nomadic tribes of Scythians and Medes were able to sweep through the
  devastated territories and strike at the very heart of the empire.
  Ashur-bani-pal was the last great monarch of Assyria. In private life he
  was cultured and scholarly, and his library, which contained copies of
  many ancient records and literary works, is one of the sources of
  Mesopotamian history. Although the Sardanapulus of Greek tradition, he
  was not the actual monarch who perished when Nineveh was captured and
  sacked about 606 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> by the fiery hillmen from
  the east. The Assyrian military organization collapsed and Assyria ceased
  to be. The factors that led to the downfall of Assyria can only be
  guessed at. It may be that its many wars of conquest had left it in a
  state of exhaustion. It is also possible that the new generation of the
  aristocratic class that grew up in wealth and luxury was disorganized by
  intrigues and corruption. After Ashur-bani-pal died, no great leader
  arose, and the vast unwieldy empire suffered from internal decay.
  Babylonia was the first to foster organized revolt. It was overrun by the
  Chaldeans from the south, who, two years after Ashur-bani-pal's death,
  set on the throne at Babylon their leader, King Nabopolassar. With him
  began the Neo-Babylonian dynasty which lasted for 86 years. He had an
  ambitious and capable son named Nebuchadnezzar, who set out, as soon as
  Nineveh fell, to seize the western portion of the Assyrian
  Empire&mdash;the Medes, with whom the Chaldeans had an agreement, being
  content to retain north-eastern Mesopotamia. The Egyptians, having
  overcome the Assyrian garrisons in the Nile valley, were by this time
  moving northward through Palestine with the idea of re-establishing their
  ancient empire in Asia. Memphis and Babylon were rival trading centres,
  and the struggle that ensued was one which was to decide which should
  have preeminence on the western Asian trade-routes, and especially the
  'clearing-houses' of North Syria. In 604 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>
  Nebuchadnezzar met and defeated Pharaoh Necho's Egyptian army at
  Carchemish. The Egyptians retreated in confusion and were pursued to
  their frontier. Nabopolassar's death in Babylon caused Nebuchadnezzar to
  return home and ascend the throne. Eight years later, <!-- Page 344

  however, he was back in Palestine again. Judah had been plotting with
  Egypt, its ally, and the Babylonian monarch besieged and captured
  Jerusalem. Thousands of Jews were carried off as captives to Babylonia.
  In 587 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> Egypt involved Judah in a second
  revolt. Nebuchadnezzar II again captured Jerusalem. This time he
  destroyed the city and carried away the greater part of the remnant of
  the Jewish people to serve his artisans and agriculturists "by Babel's
  streams". Babylon was triumphant as a political and trading centre, and,
  during Nebuchadnezzar's long reign of 42 years, prospered greatly. Its
  products and its culture were carried far and wide, and Chaldean
  astrologers as well as merchants became known in Egypt and Greece.
  Babylonia was the birthplace of the science of astronomy, which developed
  from astrology. Nebuchadnezzar was a great builder. It is the ruins of
  his Babylon that have been excavated in our own day. Although Greek
  descriptions of the city have been found to be somewhat exaggerated, it
  was yet made very strong and impressive. The royal palace was rebuilt,
  and the Hanging Garden on its terraced platform became one of the seven
  wonders of the world. Trade flourished in the capital, and a harbour was
  built at the head of the Persian Gulf to promote sea traffic. In 539
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span> Cyrus, the Persian conqueror, having
  defeated the Babylonian army, entered Babylon in state and was welcomed
  by the priests, Nabo-nidus, the last king of the Neo-Babylonian empire,
  having made them his enemies. The independence of Babylonia then came to
  an end, but the importance of its capital as a trading centre did not
  suffer sudden decline. When it was captured by Alexander the Great in 331
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span> it had been much damaged in consequence of
  revolts against Persia. The Macedonian conqueror resolved to make it his
  capital, but his early death, and subsequent political developments,
  hastened its decay. The Greeks had removed the rocks that blocked the
  Tigris, which then could be navigated by vessels from the Persian Gulf.
  Seleucus built the new capital of Seleucia on the right bank of the
  Tigris, and the traders followed the officials to the new Babylon. In
  time Ctesiphon arose on the left bank, and after the fall of the Parthian
  empire it was the principal city of the province. The Moslem conquest of
  Mesopotamia in the seventh century of our era brought about the rise of
  Bagdad, a few miles to the north of Ctesiphon. It will be noted that all
  these cities are strategically situated in the neck of land, between the
  rivers, which is crossed by the caravan roads leading east and west.
  During the reign of the famous Harun al Rashid (786-809) Bagdad was at
  the height of its splendour. A portion of this ruler's great palace still
  remains, and the tomb of Zobiede, his queen, is a prominent feature on
  the outskirts of the city. Bagdad declined as a trading centre after
  Vasco da Gama discovered the sea-route to India, and diverted the
  merchandise previously carried to Europe across the overland routes
  across Persia and through Mesopotamia and Asia Minor. Bagdad afterwards
  depended chiefly on the traffic caused by pilgrim caravans to and from
  Mecca. The disastrous neglect of Babylonia's irrigation system occurred
  under Turkish rule. Towards the close of the nineteenth century Germany
  obtained concessions from the Turks and planned the Bagdad railway, so as
  to reopen the ancient overland trade-route for Indo-Persian trade.
  British interests in the Persian Gulf were seriously threatened by this
  scheme. When war broke out in 1914, a British force landed in ancient
  Chaldea and pushed northward. Bagdad, the modern Babylon, was captured in
  1917, and Mosul (Nineveh) was occupied in 1918. The Peace Treaty between
  the Allied Powers and Turkey placed Mesopotamia under the protection of
  Great Britain, which thus secured control of the Bagdad railway. An
  extensive irrigation scheme in the <!-- Page 345 --><span

  valley promises to restore ancient Babylonia to its importance as one of
  the great grain-yielding areas of the world.&mdash;<span

  spread the knowledge of his invention he travelled over various countries
  and received in every quarter divine honours. Drawn by lions (some say
  panthers, tigers, or lynxes), he began his march, which resembled a
  triumphal procession. Those who opposed him were severely punished, but
  on those who received him hospitably he bestowed rewards. His love was
  shared by several; but Ariadne, whom he found deserted upon Naxos, alone
  was elevated to the dignity of a wife, and became a sharer of his
  immortality. In art he is represented with the round, soft, and graceful
  form of a maiden rather than with that of a young man. His long waving
  hair is knitted behind in a knot, and wreathed with sprigs of ivy and
  vine leaves. He is usually naked; sometimes he has a loose mantle hung
  negligently round his shoulders; sometimes a fawn-skin hangs across his
  breast. He is often accompanied by Silenus, Bacchantes, Satyrs, &amp;c.

  German musicians, born in 1685 at Eisenach, died in 1750 at Leipzig.
  Being the son of a musician he was early trained in the art, and soon
  distinguished himself. In 1703 he was engaged as a player at the Court of
  Weimar, and subsequently he was musical director to the Duke of
  Anhalt-Köthen, and afterwards held an appointment at Leipzig. He paid a
  visit to <!-- Page 346 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  Great. As a player on the harpsichord and organ he had no equal among his
  contemporaries; but it was not till a century after his death that his
  greatness as a composer was fully recognized. His compositions, many of
  which are pieces of sacred music, show great originality. They include
  pieces, vocal and instrumental, for the organ, piano, stringed and keyed
  instruments; church cantatas, oratorios, masses, passion music, &amp;c.
  More than fifty musical performers have proceeded from this family.
  Sebastian himself had eleven sons, all distinguished as musicians. The
  most renowned were the following:&mdash;Wilhelm Friedemann, born in 1710

  <p><b>Bacon</b>, Francis, Baron Verulam, Viscount St. Albans, and Lord

  Queen Elizabeth. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and in
  1575 was admitted to Gray's Inn. From 1576 to 1579 he was at Paris with
  Sir Amyas <!-- Page 347 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page347"></a>[347]</span>Paulet, the English ambassador. The death
  of his father called him back to England, and being left in straitened
  circumstances he zealously pursued the study of law, and was admitted a
  barrister in 1582. In 1584 he became member of Parliament for Melcombe
  Regis, and soon after drew up a <i>Letter of Advice</i> to Queen
  Elizabeth, an able political memoir. In 1586 he was member for Taunton,
  in 1589 for Liverpool. A year or two after he gained the Earl of Essex as
  a friend and patron. Bacon's talents and his connection with the
  Lord-Treasurer Burleigh, who had married his mother's sister, and his
  son, Sir Robert Cecil, First Secretary of State, seemed to promise him
  the highest promotion; but he had displeased the queen, and when he
  applied for the attorney-generalship, and next for the
  solicitor-generalship (1595), he was unsuccessful. Essex endeavoured to
  indemnify him by the donation of an estate in land. Bacon, however,
  forgot his obligations to his benefactor, and not only abandoned him as
  soon as he had fallen into disgrace, but without being obliged took part
  against him on his trial, in 1601, and was active in obtaining his
  conviction. He had been chosen member for the county of Middlesex in
  1593, and for Southampton in 1597, and had long been a Queen's Counsel.
  The reign of James I was more favourable to his interest. He was
  assiduous in courting the king's favour, and James, who was ambitious of
  being considered a patron of letters, conferred upon him in 1603 the
  honour of knighthood. In 1604 he was appointed King's Counsel, with a
  pension of £60; in 1606 he married; in 1607 he became Solicitor-General,
  and six years after Attorney-General. Between James and his Parliament he
  was anxious to produce harmony, but his efforts were without avail, and
  his obsequiousness and servility gained him enmity and discredit. In 1617
  he was made Lord-Keeper of the Seal; in 1618 Lord High Chancellor of
  England and Baron Verulam. In this year he lent his influence to bring a
  verdict of guilty against Raleigh. In 1621 he was made Viscount St.
  Albans. Soon after this his reputation received a fatal blow. A new
  Parliament was formed in 1621, and the Lord Chancellor was accused before
  the House of bribery, corruption, and other malpractices. It is difficult
  to ascertain the full extent of his guilt; but he seems to have been
  unable to justify himself, and handed in a 'confession and humble
  submission', throwing himself on the mercy of the Peers. He was condemned
  to pay a fine of £40,000, to be committed to the Tower during the
  pleasure of the king, declared incompetent to hold any office of State,
  and banished from Court for ever. The sentence, however, was never
  carried out. The fine was remitted almost as soon as imposed, and he was
  imprisoned for only a few days. He survived his fall a few years, during
  this time occupying himself with his literary and scientific works, and
  vainly hoping for political employment. In 1597 he published his
  celebrated <i>Essays</i>, which immediately became very popular, were
  successively enlarged and extended, and translated into Latin, French,
  and Italian. The treatise on the <i>Advancement of Learning</i> appeared
  in 1605; <i>The Wisdom of the Ancients</i> in 1609 (in Latin); his great
  philosophical work, the <i>Novum Organum</i> (in Latin), in 1620; and the
  <i>De Augmentis Scientiarum</i>, a much enlarged edition (in Latin) of
  the <i>Advancement</i>, in 1623. His <i>New Atlantis</i> was written
  about 1614-7; <i>Life of Henry VII</i> about 1621. Various minor
  productions also proceeded from his pen. Numerous editions of his works
  have been published, by far the best being that of Messrs. Spedding,
  Ellis, and Heath, 1857-9 (reprinted, 1879-90). Bacon was great as a
  moralist, a historian, a writer on politics, and a rhetorician; but it is
  as the father of the inductive method in science, as the powerful
  exponent of the principle that facts must be observed and collected
  before theorizing, that he occupies the grand position he holds among the
  world's great ones. His moral character, however, was not on a level with
  his intellectual, self-aggrandizement being the main aim of his life. We
  need do no more than allude to the preposterous attempt that has been
  made to prove that Bacon was the real author of the plays attributed to
  Shakespeare, an attempt that only ignorance of Bacon and Shakespeare
  could uphold and tolerate.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: J.

  <p><b>Bacon</b>, Roger, an English monk, and one of the most profound and

  Page 348 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page348"></a>[348]</span>Somersetshire, died at Oxford in 1294. He
  first entered the University of Oxford, and went afterwards to that of
  Paris, where he is said to have distinguished himself and received the
  degree of Doctor of Theology. About 1250 he returned to England, entered
  the order of Franciscans and fixed his abode at Oxford; but having
  incurred the suspicion of his ecclesiastical superiors, he was sent to
  Paris and kept in confinement for ten years, without writing-materials,
  books, or instruments. The cause seems to have been simple enough. He had
  been a diligent student of the chemical, physical, and mathematical
  sciences, and had made discoveries, and deduced results, which appeared
  so extraordinary to the ignorant that they were believed to be works of
  magic. This opinion was countenanced by the jealousy and hatred of the
  monks of his fraternity. In subsequent times he was popularly classed
  among those who had been in league with Satan. Having been set at
  liberty, he enjoyed a brief space of quiet while Clement IV was Pope; but
  in 1278 he was again thrown into prison, where he remained for at least
  ten years. Of the close of his life little is known. His most important
  work is his <i>Opus Majus</i>, where he discusses the relation of
  philosophy to religion, and then treats of language, metaphysics, optics,
  and experimental science. He was undoubtedly the earliest philosophical
  experimentalist in Britain; he made signal advances in optics; was an
  excellent chemist; and in all probability discovered gunpowder. He was
  intimately acquainted with geography and astronomy, as appears by his
  discovery of the errors of the calendar, and their causes, and by his
  proposals for correcting them, in which he approached very nearly to
  truth.&mdash;Cf. E. Charles, <i>Roger Bacon, sa vie, ses ouvrages, ses

  <p><b>Bacte´ria</b> (Gr. <i>bakt&#x113;rion</i>, a rod), a general term
  applied to the lowest visible forms of life; other names given are
  <i>germs</i> or <i>microbes</i>. They are divided into three classes: (1)
  <i>cocci</i>&mdash;these are minute spheres about one twenty-five
  thousandth of an inch in diameter, arranged in chains or clusters; (2)
  <i>bacilli</i>&mdash;these are straight rods about the breadth of a
  coccus and two to four times as long; (3) <i>spirilla</i>&mdash;here
  there are two forms; one is like a bacillus, but curved (spirillum proper
  or vibrio); the other is a very fine spiral thread (spirochaete) often
  only half the thickness of a vibrio and two to six times as long.
  Bacteria consist of protoplasm surrounded by a membrane, and many show
  active movements; they all multiply asexually by splitting, and so
  rapidly may the process occur that 17,000,000 organisms or more may be
  formed from one bacterium in twenty-four hours. The chief part played by
  bacteria in nature is to cause putrefaction. They are found on all
  organic matter, and are therefore omnipresent. When grown artificially
  (see <i>Bacteriology</i>) they usually require organic matter for their
  food, and this they split up into simpler chemical compounds, some of
  which are very poisonous to animals (toxins); they can also split up
  sugars to produce various alcohols, acids, and gases. When certain of the
  bacilli are starved, the living matter gathers itself up into a spore
  surrounded by a very resisting membrane, and it can survive for a long
  time in this condition. All ordinary bacteria, including most of those
  which produce disease, can be killed by a few minutes' boiling, but the
  sporing varieties (e.g. many putrefactive forms) withstand much longer
  boiling&mdash;up to one and a half hours; they can also be killed by
  chemical means (see <i>Disinfection</i>). Many bacteria are useful to
  man, and a few give rise to disease (see <i>Germ Theory</i>).</p>

    BACTERIA

  </div>

  <p><b>Bacteriology</b>, the branch of science which deals with the
  structure and properties of bacteria. Though the existence of bacteria
  had been known from the time when Leeuwenhock arranged lenses so as to
  form a microscope, it was through the work of Pasteur that modern
  knowledge regarding the group originated. Pasteur's discovery that yeasts
  are the cause of the formation of alcohol from sugar was followed by his
  showing that bacteria are responsible for other processes of a similar
  character, e.g. the formation of vinegar from alcohol, the occurrence of
  the rancid change in butter, &amp;c. When he went on to prove that a
  bacterium was the cause of a disease of silkworms, a stimulus was given
  to the germ theory of infection, and bacteriology was thus early brought
  intimately into contact with medical science. Another stimulus to
  bacteriological inquiry came from the controversy on spontaneous
  generation, and Pasteur was one of those who helped to establish the
  principle that the new development of living things, as represented by
  bacteria, out of non-living matter does not take place. This led to the
  inevitable deduction that all putrefactive processes are due to bacteria.
  On this Lister founded his antiseptic treatment of wounds, the practical
  effects of which focused attention on the important part played by
  bacteria in human affairs. The modern science of bacteriology really
  dates from 1877, when Koch proved that <i>Bacillus anthracis</i> is the
  cause of anthrax in <!-- Page 349 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page349"></a>[349]</span>cattle. The outstanding feature of Koch's
  research was that in it, for the first time, methods were employed
  whereby all extraneous organisms were excluded from the inquiry, and the
  way was thus opened up for the study of the properties and effects of one
  species of bacterium acting by itself. The chief aspects of his work were
  as follows: (1) the determination of the temperatures at which bacteria
  are killed; the knowledge of this enables investigators to render free
  from living organisms their apparatus and the food materials (usually
  called <i>media</i>) necessary to support bacterial life (this is called
  <i>sterilization</i>); (2) the discovery that the insertion of a plug of
  cotton-wool in the neck of a vessel (e.g. a flask or test-tube) before
  its sterilization constitutes a sufficient filter, which prevents
  bacteria in the outside air gaining access to its interior or to any food
  medium placed in it for sterilization; (3) the elaboration of a series of
  media capable of acting as food for all the commonly occurring bacteria;
  (4) the introduction of a simple method of separating from one another
  bacterial species which in nature are often growing side by side. This is
  effected by making media containing a jelly (e.g. gelatine) which melts
  at a relatively low temperature. The bacterial mixture is well diluted in
  the melted medium, and this is poured out in a thin layer on a sterile
  glass plate and allowed to set. Each individual bacterial cell can thus
  multiply apart from neighbouring cells, and, it may be, in a few hours
  the resulting growth (a 'colony') is visible to the naked eye. A minute
  part of the colony is picked off with a heated needle and placed on a
  mass of sterile medium. In this way a 'pure culture' of each species
  present in the original mixture can be obtained. Koch's work was chiefly
  concerned with disease bacteria, and between 1880 and 1895 many such
  organisms were isolated in pure culture and their properties investigated
  (see <i>Germ Theory of Disease</i>).</p>

  <p>While in the evolution of knowledge the progress of bacteriology has
  been most associated with that of medicine and surgery, the science has
  fundamental relations with many other human interests, and the same
  methods are used in investigating such relationships. The adaptation of
  these methods on a commercial scale underlies all industrial processes
  concerned in the preserving of milk and in the canning and bottling of
  meat and fruit (apart from the addition of chemical preservatives). Since
  bacteriology came into existence, many of the most primitive domestic
  procedures have been improved and placed on a scientific basis. Thus,
  butter-making involves a previous souring of the milk; this is due to
  bacterial action, and standard mixtures of milk-souring bacteria are now
  regularly supplied by the laboratory as 'starters' of the process. It is
  recognized that the disorders of milk, e.g. 'ropiness', 'blue milk',
  &amp;c., are due to certain 'wild' bacteria gaining access to the dairy.
  The ripening of such cheeses as Gorgonzola and Stilton is due to bacteria
  and allied organisms, and here again light has been shed on the
  'diseases' of cheese by bacteriological investigation. The pickling of
  foods by salt, or vinegar, or nitre, is due to the action of these
  substances as antiseptics, and a similar principle, aided by boiling,
  underlies the making of jams. Again, certain kinds of bacteria which only
  flourish at high temperatures are responsible for the heating of hay and
  corn stacks, and for the production of ensilage. Bacteriology is also
  throwing important light on factors concerned in the fertility of soils.
  For example, it has been shown that the little nodules on the roots of
  plants of the pea tribe are caused by bacteria; these, in growing, take
  up nitrogen from the air, and form compounds which promote the growth of
  the plant on which they are parasites and remain to enrich the soil when
  the plant dies. In short, there is no industry, which depends on natural
  putrefaction being prevented or modified so as to stop at a particular
  stage, which bacteriology cannot guide towards securing the most perfect
  results.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: Fischer, <i>The

  <p><b>Baden</b> (bä´d&#x117;n), formerly a Grand-Duchy and one of the
  more important States of the German Empire, situated in the <span
  class="scac">S.W.</span> of Germany, to the west of Württemberg. It is
  divided into four districts, Constance, Freiburg, Karlsruhe, and
  Mannheim. It has an area of 5819 sq. miles, and a pop. of 2,142,833. It
  is mountainous, being traversed to a considerable extent by the lofty
  plateau of the Schwarzwald or Black Forest, which attains its highest
  point in the Feldberg (4904 feet). The nucleus of this plateau consists
  of gneiss and granite. In the north it sinks down towards the Odenwald,
  which is, however, of different geological structure, being composed for
  the most part of red sandstone. The whole of Baden, except a small
  portion in the <span class="scac">S.E.</span>, in which the Danube takes
  its rise, belongs to the basin of the Rhine, which bounds it on the south
  and west. Numerous tributaries of the Rhine intersect it, the chief being
  the Neckar. Lakes are numerous, and include a considerable part of the
  Lake of Constance. The climate varies much. The hilly parts, especially
  in the east, are cold and have a long winter, while the valley of the
  Rhine enjoys the finest climate of Germany. The principal minerals worked
  are coal, salt, iron, zinc, and nickel. The number of mineral springs is
  remarkably great, and of these not a few are of great celebrity. The
  vegetation is peculiarly rich, and there are magnificent forests. The
  cereals comprise wheat, oats, barley, and rye. Potatoes, hemp, tobacco,
  wine, and sugar-beet are largely produced. Several of the wines, both
  white and red, rank in the first class. Baden has long been famous for
  its fruits also. Of the total area 55.4 per cent is under cultivation,
  39.4 per cent under forest, and 5.2 per cent uncultivated (houses, roads,
  water, &amp;c.). The farms are mostly quite small. The manufactures are
  important. Among them are textiles, tobacco and cigars, chemicals,
  machinery, pottery ware, jewellery (especially at Pforzheim), wooden
  clocks, confined chiefly to the districts of the Black Forest, musical
  boxes and other musical toys. The capital is Karlsruhe, about 5 miles
  from the Rhine; the other chief towns are Mannheim, Freiburg-im-Breisgau
  (with a Roman Catholic university), Baden, and Heidelberg. Baden has warm
  mineral springs, which were known and used in the time of the Romans.
  Heidelberg has a university (Protestant), founded in 1386, the oldest in
  Germany. The railways have a length of 1200 miles, and are all State
  property. In the time of the Roman Empire southern Baden belonged to the
  Roman province of Rhætia. Under the old German Empire it was a
  margraviate, which in 1533 was divided into Baden-Baden and
  Baden-Durlach, but reunited in 1771. The title of grand-duke was
  conferred by Napoleon in 1806, and in the same year Baden was extended to
  its present limits. Until 1918 the executive power was vested in the
  grand-duke, the legislative in a house of legislature, consisting of an
  upper and a lower chamber. The former consisted partly of hereditary
  members; the latter of elected representatives of the people. In the
  break-up of the German Empire in Nov., 1918, Baden was among the first
  States to feel the shock of revolution. The Grand-Duke Frederick I
  abdicated, and the Provisional Government, under the Socialist Herr
  Jeiss, proclaimed Baden a Republic. Two-thirds of the population are
  Roman Catholics, the rest Protestants.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Badger</b> (baj´&#x117;r), a plantigrade, carnivorous mammal,
  allied both to the bears and to the weasels, of a clumsy make, with short
  thick legs, and long claws on the fore-feet. The common badger (<i>Meles
  vulg&#x101;ris</i>) is as large as a middling-sized dog, but much lower
  on the legs, with a flatter and broader body, very thick tough hide, and
  long coarse hair. It inhabits the north of Europe and Asia, burrows, is
  indolent and sleepy, feeds by night on vegetables, small quadrupeds,
  &amp;c. Its flesh may be eaten, and its hair is used for artists' brushes
  in painting. The American badger belongs to a separate genus. <i>Badger
  baiting</i>, or <i>drawing the badger</i>, is a barbarous sport, long a
  favourite amusement in England, but declared illegal in the middle of
  last century, and yet to some extent practised, generally as an
  attraction to public-houses of the lowest sort. A badger is put in a
  barrel, and one or more dogs are put in to drag him out. When this is
  effected he is returned to his barrel, to be similarly assailed by a
  fresh set. The badger usually makes a most determined and savage
  resistance.</p>

  <p><b>Bagatelle´</b>, a game played on a long flat board covered with
  cloth like a billiard-table, with spherical balls and a cue or mace. At
  the end of the board are nine cups or sockets of just sufficient size to
  receive the balls. These sockets are arranged in the form of a regular
  octagon, with the ninth in the middle, and are numbered consecutively
  from one upwards. Nine balls are used, generally one black, four white,
  and four red, the distinction between white and red being made only for
  the sake of variety. In the ordinary game, at starting, the black ball is
  placed on a point in the longitudinal middle line of the board, a few
  inches in front of the nearest <!-- Page 352 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page352"></a>[352]</span>of the sockets, and the player places one
  of his eight balls on a corresponding point at the other end of the
  board, and tries to strike the black ball into one of the sockets with
  his own. After this his object is to place as many of his balls as
  possible in the sockets. Each ball so placed counts as many as the socket
  is numbered for, and the black ball always counts double. He who first
  makes the number of points agreed on wins.</p>

  <p><b>Bagdad´</b>, or <b>Baghdad</b>, a city of a vilayet of same name
  (54,540 sq. miles; pop. 900,000) in what was anciently Mesopotamia. The
  greater part of it lies on the eastern bank of the Tigris, which is
  crossed by a bridge of boats; old Bagdad, the residence of the caliphs
  (now in ruins), was on the western bank of the river. The city occupies a
  large area. The houses are mostly built of brick, the streets unpaved and
  very narrow, and there are few buildings of any note. The palace of the
  governor is spacious. Of the mosques only a few attract notice, many are
  in ruins; the bazaars are large and well stocked; that of Dawd Pasha
  still ranks as one of the most splendid in the world. Manufactures:
  leather, silks, cottons, woollens, carpets, &amp;c. Steamers ply on the
  river between Bagdad and Bassorah, and the town exports wheat, dates,
  galls, gums, mohair, carpets, &amp;c., to Europe, the chief import being
  cotton goods. The estimated population is over 200,000; of these about
  86,000 are Mahommedans, 52,000 Jews, and 7000 Christians. The city has
  been frequently visited by the plague. Bagdad was founded in 762 by the
  Caliph Almansur, and raised to a high degree of splendour in the ninth
  century by Harun Al Rashid. It is the scene of a number of the tales of
  the <i>Arabian Nights</i>. It was long the chief city of the Mahommedan
  world, and at one time is said to have had two millions of inhabitants.
  In the thirteenth century it was stormed by Hulaku, grandson of
  Genghis-Khan, who caused the reigning caliph to be slain, and destroyed
  the caliphate. It was again laid waste by Timur in 1401. For a
  considerable period it was the object of contention between the Persians
  and the Turks, until it was besieged and captured by Sultan Murad IV in
  1638. Since that date it remained a part of the Turkish Empire. It was
  captured by the British on 11th March, 1917.</p>

  <p><b>Bagdad Railway</b>, a railway which, under arrangement with the
  Turkish Government, was intended to run from Konia, which is the terminus
  of the Anatolian railway system, to Bagdad, Basra (Bassorah), and the
  Persian Gulf. It was built chiefly by means of funds provided by German
  and French financiers, in association with the Anatolian Railway Company,
  a German company. The line has been constructed continuously as far as
  Kara Bunar in Cilicia. Farther on, the following sections have been
  completed: Dorak to Bagtché, on the Ordana side of the Taurus Mountains;
  Radjun, via Muslimié, to Jerablus, on the Euphrates, with a branch from
  Muslimié to Aleppo; Jerablus to El-Abiad, and Bagdad to Samara. A branch
  line has also been completed from Alexandretta to Toprak Kalé. Of the
  distance from Konia to Bagdad (1509 miles), 1117 miles (with gaps) are
  already working. In 1919 the railway system passed to the Allies, and in
  1920 it was announced that the line between Basra and Bagdad had been
  completed.</p>

  <p><b>Bagging</b> is the name of the textile material which is used in
  the making of bags. Baltic hemp was the first material used for the
  purpose, but now all kinds of fibres are used, though the majority of
  bags are made of jute fibre. The style of the bagging used depends,
  naturally, upon the requirements of the bag; for the export of raw cotton
  from the United States of America we find the coarsest of all
  cotton-bagging used. When intended to carry grain, spices, sugar,
  &amp;c., the bag must be made of closely-woven material. In many cases
  bags to carry sugar are lined with paper.</p>

  <p><b>Bagpipe</b>, a musical wind-instrument of very great antiquity,
  having been used among the ancient Greeks, and being a favourite
  instrument over Europe generally in the fifteenth century. It still
  continues in use among the country people of Poland, Italy, the south of
  France, and in Scotland and Ireland. Though now often regarded as the
  national instrument of Scotland, especially Celtic Scotland, it is only
  Scottish by adoption, being introduced into that country from England. It
  consists of a leathern bag, which receives the air from the mouth, or
  from bellows; and of pipes, into which the air is pressed from the bag by
  the performer's elbow. In the common or Highland form, one pipe (called
  the <i>chanter</i>) plays the melody; of the three others (called
  <i>drones</i>) two are in unison with the lowest <i>A</i> of the chanter,
  and the third and longest an octave lower, the sound being produced by
  means of reeds. The chanter has eight holes, which the performer stops
  and opens at pleasure, but the scale is imperfect and the tone harsh. The
  Highland bagpipe is a powerful instrument, and calls for great exertion
  of the lungs in order that the air may be supplied in sufficient
  quantity. There are several other species of bagpipes, as the soft and
  melodious Irish bagpipe, supplied with wind by a bellows, and having
  several keyed drones and a keyed chanter; the old English bagpipe (now no
  longer used); the Italian bagpipe, a very rude instrument, &amp;c. The
  Irish bagpipe is, musically speaking, the most perfect of
  all.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: Sir J.&nbsp;G. Dalyell,

  <p><b>Baikie</b>, William Balfour, born in the Orkney Islands 1824, died
  at Sierra Leone 1863. He joined the British navy, and was made surgeon
  and naturalist of the Niger Expedition, 1854. He took the command on the
  death of the senior officer, and explored the Niger for 250 miles.
  Another expedition, which started in 1857, passed two years in exploring,
  when the vessel was wrecked, and all the members, with the exception of
  Baikie, returned to England. With none but native assistants he formed a
  settlement at the confluence of the Benué and the Quorra, in which he was
  ruler, teacher, and physician, and within a few years he opened the Niger
  to navigation, made roads, and established a market.</p>

  <p><b>Bailie</b>, or <b>Baillie</b>, a municipal officer or magistrate in
  Scotland, corresponding to an <i>alderman</i> in England. The criminal
  jurisdiction of the provost and bailies of royal burghs extends to
  breaches of the peace, drunkenness, adulteration of articles of diet,
  thefts not of an aggravated character, and other offences of a less
  serious nature.</p>

  <p><b>Bailiff</b>, a civil officer or functionary, subordinate to someone
  else. There are several kinds of bailiffs, whose offices widely differ,
  but all agree in this, that the keeping or protection of something
  belongs to them. In England the sheriff is the monarch's bailiff, and his
  county is a bailiwick. The name is also applied to the chief magistrates
  of some towns, to keepers of royal castles, as of Dover, to persons
  having the conservation of the peace in hundreds and in some special
  jurisdictions, as Westminster, and to the returning officers in the same.
  But the officials commonly designated by this name are the
  <i>bailiffs</i> of sheriffs, or sheriffs' officers, who execute
  processes, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Bailleul</b> (ba<span class="x1"><span

  but it was not destroyed until the campaign of 1918. Pop. 12,828.&mdash;A
  village of the same name in department Orne gave its name to the Baliol
  family.</p>

  <p><b>Baillie</b>, Joanna, a Scottish authoress, born at Bothwell,
  Lanarkshire, in 1762, died at Hampstead, 1851. She removed in early life
  to London, where her brother, Matthew Baillie, was settled as a
  physician. Here in 1798 she published her first work, entitled <i>A
  Series of Plays</i>, in which she attempted to delineate the stronger
  passions by making each passion the subject of a tragedy and a comedy.
  The series was followed up by a second volume in 1802, and a third in
  1812. A second series appeared in 1836, and a complete edition of her
  whole dramatic works in 1850. She also published a volume of
  miscellaneous poetry, including songs, in 1841. Her only plays performed
  on the stage were a tragedy entitled the <i>Family Legend</i>, brought
  out at Edinburgh under the patronage <!-- Page 356 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page356"></a>[356]</span>of Sir Walter Scott;
  and <i>De Montfort</i>, brought out by John Kemble, who acted in it with
  Mrs. Siddons.</p>

  <p><b>Baillie</b>, Matthew, <span class="scac">M.D.</span>, physician and
  anatomist, brother of the preceding, was born 1761 at Shotts,
  Lanarkshire, died at Cirencester, Gloucestershire, in 1823. In 1773 he
  was sent to the University of Glasgow. He afterwards studied anatomy
  under his maternal uncles, John and William Hunter, and entered Oxford,
  where he graduated as <span class="scac">M.D.</span> In 1783 he succeeded
  his uncle as lecturer on anatomy in London, where he acquired a high
  reputation as a teacher and demonstrator, having also a large practice.
  In 1810 he was appointed physician to George III. His work on <i>The
  Morbid Anatomy of Some of the Most Important Parts of the Human Body</i>
  gave him a European reputation.</p>

  <p><b>Baillie</b>, Robert, an eminent Scottish Presbyterian clergyman,
  was born at Glasgow in 1599, died 1662. Though educated and ordained as
  an Episcopalian, he resisted the attempt of Archbishop Laud to introduce
  his <i>Book of Common Prayer</i> into Scotland, and joined the
  Presbyterian party. In 1638 he represented the presbytery of Irvine in
  the General Assembly at Glasgow, which dissolved Episcopacy in Scotland.
  In 1640 he was selected to go to London, with other commissioners, to
  draw up the accusation against Archbishop Laud. Of this, and almost all
  the other proceedings of his public life, he has left a minute account in
  his letters and journals, which form a most valuable collection for the
  history of his time. In 1642 he was appointed professor of divinity at
  Glasgow. He was a member of the Westminster Assembly of Divines, and
  attended its sittings from 1643-6. After the Restoration, though made
  principal of his college through Court patronage, he did not hesitate to
  express his dissatisfaction with the reintroduction of Episcopacy.</p>

  <p><b>Baillie</b>, Robert, of Jerviswood, in Lanarkshire, a Scottish
  patriot of the reign of Charles II. He brought himself into notice by
  opposing the tyrannical measures of Archbishop Sharpe against the
  Nonconformists, for which he was fined 6000 merks (or £500) and
  imprisoned for four months. In 1683 he went to London in furtherance of a
  scheme of emigration to South Carolina taken up by a number of Scottish
  gentlemen, as being the only way of escaping the tyranny of the
  Government. He became associated with Monmouth, Sydney, Russell, and the
  rest of that party, and was charged with complicity in the Rye-house
  plot. After a long imprisonment, during which vain attempts were made to
  obtain evidence against him, he was brought before the Court of
  Justiciary (23rd Dec., 1684), was found guilty, and condemned to be
  executed that afternoon.</p>

  <p><b>Baillieston</b>, a town of Scotland, in Lanarkshire, a few miles
  east of Glasgow, with extensive collieries, in which many of the

  <p><b>Bailly</b> (ba<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>-y&#x113;), Jean Sylvain, French
  astronomer and statesman, born at Paris 1736. After some youthful essays
  in verse, he was induced by Lacaille to devote himself to astronomy, and
  on the death of the latter in 1753, being admitted to the Academy of
  Sciences, he published a reduction of Lacaille's observations on the
  zodiacal stars. In 1764 he competed ably but unsuccessfully for the
  Academy prize offered for an essay upon Jupiter's satellites, Lagrange
  being his opponent; and in 1771 he published a treatise on the light
  reflected by these satellites. In the meantime he had won distinction as
  a man of letters by his <i>Éloges</i> on Pierre Corneille, Leibnitz,
  Molière, and others; and the same qualities of style shown by these were
  maintained in his <i>History of Astronomy</i> (1775-87), his most
  extensive work. In 1784 the French Academy elected him a member. The
  revolution drew him into public life. Paris chose him, 12th May, 1789,
  first deputy of the <i>tiers-état</i>, and in the Assembly itself he was
  made first president, a post occupied by him on 20th June, 1789, in the
  session of the Tennis Court, when the deputies swore never to separate
  till they had given France a new constitution. As Mayor of Paris his
  moderation and impartial enforcement of the law failed to commend
  themselves to the people, and his forcible suppression of mob violence,
  17th July, 1791, aroused a storm which led to his resignation and retreat
  to Nantes. In 1793 he attempted to join Laplace at Melun, but was
  recognized and sent to Paris, where he was condemned by the revolutionary
  tribunal, and executed on 12th Nov.</p>

  <p><b>Bailment</b>, in law, is the delivery of a chattel or thing to a
  person in trust, either for the use of the bailer or person delivering,
  or for that of the bailee or person to whom it is delivered. A bailment
  always supposes the subject to be delivered only for a limited time, at
  the expiration of which it must be re-delivered to the bailer, the
  responsibility of the bailee being dependent, in some degree, upon the
  contract on which the bailment is made. Pledging and letting for hire are
  species of bailment. <i>Agistment</i>, or the taking in of cattle or live
  stock to feed at a rate of so much per head, is a contract of
  bailment.</p>

  <p><b>Baily</b>, Edward Hodges, an English sculptor, born at Bristol

  <p><b>Baily</b>, Francis, astronomer, born in Berkshire 1774; settled in
  London as a stockbroker in 1802. While thus actively engaged he published
  <i>Tables for the Purchasing and Renewing of Leases</i>, <i>The Doctrine
  of Interest and Annuities</i>, <i>The Doctrine of Life Annuities and
  Assurances</i>, and an epitome of universal history. On retiring from
  business with an ample fortune in 1825 he turned his attention to
  astronomy, became one of the founders of the Astronomical Society,
  contributed to its <i>Transactions</i>, and in 1835 published a life of
  Flamsteed. He died in 1844.</p>

  <p><b>Baily's Beads</b>, a phenomenon attending eclipses of the sun, the
  unobscured edge of which appears discontinuous and broken immediately
  before and after the moment of complete obscuration. It is classed as an
  effect of irradiation, and is caused by the sun shining through the
  depressions between the lunar mountains.</p>

  <p><b>Bain</b>, Alexander, Scottish philosopher and educationalist, was
  born at Aberdeen in 1818. He was educated at Marischal College (then a
  separate university), Aberdeen; was for some years a deputy professor in
  the university; subsequently held official posts in London; and in 1860
  was appointed professor of logic and English in Aberdeen University, a
  post which he held till his resignation in 1881. His most important works
  are: <i>The Senses and the Intellect</i> (1855); <i>The Emotions and the
  Will</i> (1859), together forming a complete exposition of the human
  mind; <i>Mental and Moral Science</i> (1868); <i>Logic, Deductive and
  Inductive</i> (1870); <i>Mind and Body</i> (1873); <i>Education as a
  Science</i> (1879); <i>James Mill, a Biography</i> (1881); <i>John Stuart
  Mill, a Criticism with Personal Recollections</i> (1882); besides an
  <i>English Grammar</i>; <i>English Composition and Rhetoric</i>; an
  <i>Autobiography</i>, &amp;c. Bain was at once grammarian, rhetorician,
  educationalist, and logician, but his fame rests on his contributions to
  psychology. He died in 1903.</p>

  <p><b>Bairam</b> (b&#x12B;´ram), the Easter of the Mohammedans, which
  follows immediately after the Ramadan or Lent (a month of fasting), and
  lasts three days. This feast during the course of thirty-three years
  makes a complete circuit of all the months and seasons, as the Turks
  reckon by lunar years. Sixty days after this first great Bairam begins
  the lesser Bairam. They are the only two feasts prescribed by the
  Mohammedan religion.</p>

  <p><b>Baird</b>, Sir David, a distinguished British soldier, was born in
  Aberdeenshire in 1757, and entered the army 1772. Having been promoted to
  a lieutenancy in 1778 he sailed for India, distinguished himself as a
  captain in the war against Hyder Ali, was wounded and taken prisoner, and
  confined in the fortress of Seringapatam for nearly four years. He and
  his fellow-prisoners were treated with great barbarity, and many of them
  died or were put to death, but at last (in 1784) all that survived were
  set at liberty. In 1787 he became major, and in 1791 joined the army
  under Cornwallis as lieutenant-colonel, and was appointed to the command
  of a brigade in the war against Tippoo. After much hard service he was
  made a colonel in 1795, went in 1797 to the Cape of Good Hope as
  brigadier-general, and in 1798, on his appointment as major-general,
  returned to India. In 1799 he commanded the storming party at the assault
  of Seringapatam, and, in requital, was presented with the State sword of
  Tippoo Saib. Being appointed in 1800 to command an expedition to Egypt,
  he landed at Kosseir in June, 1801, crossed the desert, and, embarking on
  the Nile, descended to Cairo, and thence to Alexandria, which he reached
  a few days before it surrendered to General Hutchinson. Next year he
  returned to India, but being soon after superseded by Sir Arthur
  Wellesley (Wellington), he sailed for Britain, where he was knighted and
  made <span class="scac">K.B.</span> With the rank of lieutenant-general
  he commanded an expedition in 1805 to the Cape of Good Hope, and in 1806,
  after defeating the Dutch, he received the surrender of the colony. He
  commanded a division at the siege of Copenhagen, and after a short period
  of service in Ireland sailed with 10,000 men for Corunna, where he formed
  a junction with Sir John Moore. He commanded the first division of
  Moore's army, and in the battle of Corunna lost his left arm. By the
  death of Sir John Moore, Sir David succeeded to the chief command,
  receiving for the fourth time the thanks of Parliament, and a baronetcy.
  In 1814 he was made a general. He died in 1829.</p>

  1887. From 1850 to 1878 he was assistant secretary, and then became
  secretary, of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, and was also chief
  Government commissioner of fish and fisheries. He wrote much on natural
  history, his chief works being <i>The Birds of North America</i> (in

  <p><b>Baius</b>, or <b>De Bay</b>, Michael, Catholic theologian, was born
  1513, in Hainaut, educated at Louvain, made professor of theology there
  in 1552, and chosen a member of the Council of Trent in 1563. Leaving the
  scholastic method, he founded systematic theology directly upon the Bible
  and the Christian fathers, of whom he particularly followed St.
  Augustine. His doctrines of original sin and of salvation by grace led to
  his persecution as a heretic by the old Scotists, and the Jesuits, who
  succeeded in obtaining a Papal bull in 1567, condemning the doctrines
  imputed to him. Baius, however, remained in the possession of his
  dignities, was appointed in 1575 Chancellor of Louvain University; and
  the King of Spain even conferred upon him the office of
  Inquisitor-General in the Netherlands. He died in 1589. His Augustinian
  views descended to the Jansenists, while his doctrine of pure undivided
  love to God formed the staple of Quietism. His system is called
  <i>Baianism</i>.</p>

  emperor, who, in 1389, having strangled his brother Jacob, succeeded his
  father Murad or Amurath, who fell in the battle of Kossovo while fighting
  against the Serbians. From the rapidity of his conquests he received the
  name of <i>Ilderim</i>, the Lightning. In three years he overcame
  Bulgaria, part of Serbia, Macedonia, Thessaly, and the States of Asia
  Minor, and besieged Constantinople for ten years, defeating Sigismund and
  the allied Hungarians, Poles, and French in 1395. The attack of Timur
  (Tamerlane) on Natolia, in 1400, saved the Greek Empire, Bajazet being
  defeated and taken prisoner by him near Ancyra, Galatia, 1402. The story
  of his being carried about in a cage by Timur is improbable; but Bajazet
  died, in 1409, in Timur's camp, in Caramania. His successor was Soliman
  I.</p>

  <p><b>Bajazet II</b> succeeded his father, Mohammed II, Sultan of the

  Lepanto, Modon, and Durazzo in a war against the Venetians, and ravaged
  the coasts of the Christian States on the Mediterranean, to revenge the
  expulsion of the Moors from Spain. Having abdicated in favour of his
  younger son Selim, he died on his way to a residence near Adrianople in
  1513. He did much for the improvement of his empire and the promotion of

  <p><b>Baker</b>, Sir Richard, an English historian, born in Kent in 1568,
  educated at Oxford, knighted in 1603 by James I, and in 1620 appointed
  High Sheriff of Oxfordshire, where he had estates. Having given security
  for a debt incurred by his wife's family, he was thrown into Fleet
  Prison, where, after remaining some years, he died in 1645. During his
  imprisonment he wrote some devotional books and his <i>Chronicle of the

  travels, which lasted several years, in the Upper Nile regions, and
  resulted, among other discoveries, in that of Albert Nyanza Lake in 1864,
  and of the exit of the White Nile from it. In <!-- Page 359 --><span

  <p><b>Bakewell</b>, Robert, an English agriculturist, celebrated for his
  improvements in the breeding of sheep, cattle, and horses, was born in
  Leicestershire in 1725, and died in 1795. He commenced experiments in
  breeding sheep, about 1755, upon his father's farm at Dishley, and for
  fifty years devoted himself to the acquisition and diffusion of
  information upon the subject. He was the originator of the new
  Leicestershire breed of sheep, which has since been so well known, and
  also of a breed of cattle very famous in their day. The demand for his
  rams increased so considerably, that whereas he let them for the season
  at £16 per head in 1755, by 1789 they were hired at 6000 guineas. Various
  improvements in farm management were also introduced by him.</p>

  <p><b>Baku</b> (bä-kö´), a Russian port on the western shore of the
  Caspian, occupying part of the Peninsula of Apsheron. The naphtha or
  petroleum springs of Baku have long been known; and the Field of Fire, so
  called from emitting inflammable gases, has long been a place of
  pilgrimage with the Guebres or Fire-worshippers. From the development of
  the petroleum industry, Baku has greatly increased, and is now a large
  and flourishing town. About 1500 oil-wells are in operation, producing
  immense quantities of petroleum (6,448,000 tons in 1917), much of which
  is led direct in pipes from the wells to the refineries in Baku, and it
  is intended to lay a pipe for its conveyance all the way to the Black Sea
  at Batoum, which is already connected with Baku by railway. Some of the
  wells have had such an outflow of oil as to be unmanageable, and the Baku
  petroleum now competes successfully with any other in the markets of the
  world. Baku, formerly the station of the Caspian fleet, is strongly
  fortified, and has a large shipping trade. The district of Baku lies
  within the limits of the new Republic of Azerbaijan. Pop. 237,000; pop.

  <p><b>Baku´nin</b>, Michael, Russian anarchist, the founder of Nihilism,
  born 1814 of a rich and noble family, entered the army, but threw up his
  commission after two years' service, and studied philosophy at Moscow,
  with his friends Hertzen, Turgeniev, Granovski (historian), and Byelinski
  (critic). Having adopted Hegel's system as the basis of a new revolution,
  he went in 1841 to Berlin, and thence to Dresden, Geneva, and Paris, as
  the propagandist of anarchism. Wherever he went he caused disturbance,
  and after undergoing imprisonment in various States, was handed over to
  Russia in 1851 by Austria, imprisoned for five years, and finally sent to
  Siberia. Escaping thence through Japan, he joined Hertzen in London on
  the staff of the <i>Kolokol</i>. His extreme views, however, ruined the
  paper and led to a quarrel with Marx and the Internationale; and having
  fallen into disrepute with his own party in Russia, he died <!-- Page 360
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page360"></a>[360]</span>suddenly and
  almost alone at Berne in 1878. He demanded the entire abolition of the
  State as a State, the absolute equalization of individuals, and the
  extirpation of hereditary rights and of religion, his conception of the
  next stage of social progress being purely negative and annihilatory.</p>

  aiding in the perversion of the Israelites to the worship of Baal, and as
  being, therefore, slain in the Midianitish war (<i>Num.</i> xxxi;
  <i>Josh.</i> xiii). He is the subject of many rabbinical fables, the

  1901. Born at Barcelona, he studied law there, and, becoming learned in
  Catalonian history, was appointed archivist and soon after professor of
  history. In 1869 he entered the Cortes as a Liberal; in 1872 was Minister
  of Public Works; from 1886 to 1888 Colonial Minister. He wrote much both
  in prose and verse, his prose comprising historical works, novels,
  &amp;c., his verse lyrics, ballads, tragedies, odes, &amp;c. His
  tragedies were partly on subjects taken from Catalonian history, partly
  on subjects connected with Greek and Roman history or literature. Among
  his lyrical and other poems are: <i>El Trovador de Montserrat</i>;
  <i>Primavera de Ultimo Trovador Catalan</i>; <i>Poesias Completas</i>
  (1874); <i>Obras Poeticas</i> (1880). <i>Don Juan de Serrallonga</i> is

  it was captured by the British, who used the harbour as a base of
  supplies. The famous battle of Balaklava was fought some distance to the
  north of the seaport, on 25th Oct., 1854. The Russians brought a force of
  25,000 men against the allies, a much larger force than they had to
  encounter, and the chief incidents in the battle were as follows: The
  Russians captured a series of positions occupied by the Turks in front of
  the British position; a Russian cavalry charge was repulsed by the 93rd
  Highlanders; a great mass of Russian cavalry was defeated by a charge of
  British heavy cavalry; the British light cavalry brigade charged and took
  a Russian battery, and put to flight the cavalry behind it, but were
  compelled by overpowering force to retreat with heavy loss, their retreat
  being covered by a brilliant charge of the French. The celebrated charge
  of the light brigade, or of the 'six hundred', though a brilliant feat of
  arms, was made under an erroneous interpretation of orders; that of the
  heavy brigade was equally glorious, and contributed far more to the final
  repulse of the enemy.</p>

  <p><b>Bal´ance</b>, an instrument for determining the relative weights of
  bodies. Balances are of various forms; in that most commonly used a
  horizontal beam rests so as to turn easily upon a fulcrum in the middle.
  From the extremities of the beam, called the centres of suspension, hang
  the scales; and a slender metal pointer between them, and in front of the
  fulcrum, indicates when the beam is level. The characteristics of a good
  balance are: (1) that the beam should rest in a horizontal position when
  the scales are either empty or loaded with equal weights; (2) that a very
  small addition of weight put into either scale should cause the beam to
  deviate from the level, which property is denominated the sensibility of
  the balance; (3) that when the beam is deflected from the horizontal
  position by inequality of the weights on the scales, it should have a
  tendency speedily to restore itself and come to rest in the level, which
  property is called the stability of the balance. To secure these
  qualities the arms of the beam should be exactly similar, equal in weight
  and length, and as long as possible; the centres of gravity and
  suspension should be in one straight line, and the fulcrum immediately
  above the centre of gravity; and the fulcrum and the centres of
  suspension should cause as little friction as possible. The fulcrum ought
  to be a knife-edge; and if the balance requires to be very delicate, the
  centres of suspension ought to be knife-edges also. If the balance has no
  tendency to one position more than another, when the scales are either
  loaded, empty, or off altogether, it is proof that the centre of gravity
  and the fulcrum coincide, and the remedy is to lower the centre of
  gravity. If the beam is disturbed by a small addition of weight to either
  scale, and exhibits no tendency to resume the horizontal position, we may
  infer that the centre of gravity is above the fulcrum. If it requires a
  considerable excess of weight to deflect the beam from the level, we may
  infer either that there is too much friction at the fulcrum, or that the
  centre of gravity is too low. If two weights are found to be in
  equipoise, one being in each scale, and if, when that which is in one
  scale is put into the other, there is no longer equilibrium, then we may
  infer that the arms of the beam are of unequal lengths. For purposes of
  accuracy, balances have occasionally means of raising or depressing the
  centre of gravity, of regulating the length of the arms, &amp;c., and the
  whole apparatus is usually enclosed in a glass case, to prevent the heat
  from expanding the arms unequally, or currents of air from disturbing the
  equilibrium. A refinement in weighing is obtained by the use of the
  milligram rider, a short bent wire which can be moved along a scale
  engraved on the beam.</p>

  <p>Of the other forms of balance, the Roman balance, or steel-yard,
  consists of a lever moving freely upon a suspended fulcrum, the shorter
  arm of the lever having a scale or pan attached to it, and the longer
  arm, along which slides a weight, being graduated to indicate quantities.
  It is commonly used for weighing loaded carts, for luggage at railway
  stations, &amp;c. A variety of this, the Danish balance, has the weight
  fixed at the end of the lever, the fulcrum being movable along the
  graduated index. The spring-balance registers the weight of an article by
  the extent to which it draws out or compresses a spiral spring. It is of
  service where a high degree of exactness is not required, as in its
  domestic use, and it also finds application in the dynamometer for
  measuring horse-power of machinery. An extremely ingenious balance, used
  in the Mint and the Bank of England, for weighing 'blanks' and
  sovereigns, distributes them automatically into three compartments
  according as they are light, heavy, or the exact weight. The Roberval
  balance is a form in common use for weighing letters and
  parcels.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: E.&nbsp;A. Brauer, <i>The

  <p><b>Balance of Power</b>, a political principle which first came to be
  recognized in modern Europe in the sixteenth century, though it appears
  to have been also acted on by the Greeks in ancient times, in preserving
  the relations between their different States. The object in maintaining
  the balance of power is to secure the general independence of nations as
  a whole, by preventing the aggressive attempts of individual States to
  extend their territory and sway at the expense of weaker countries. The
  first European monarch whose ambitious designs induced a combination of
  other States to counteract them was the Emperor Charles V, similar
  coalitions being formed in the end of the seventeenth century, when the
  ambition of Louis XIV excited the fears of Europe, and a century later
  against the exorbitant power and aggressive schemes of the first
  Napoleon. Since that time we have the instance of the Crimean War,
  entered into to check the ambition of Russia. Of late years there has
  been a marked tendency among British politicians to decry and impugn the
  principle of the balance of power, as calculated only to propagate a
  system of mutual hostility, and retard the cause of progress, by the
  expenditure both of money and life thus occasioned. An equilibrium
  between the various Powers is, of course, essential to the very existence
  of international law. The war of 1914-8 has proved to the world that in
  the absence of any central authority neither treaties nor signatures
  could prevent a State sufficiently powerful from ignoring <!-- Page 362
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page362"></a>[362]</span>the law and
  acting solely according to its interests and ambitious designs. See

  <p><b>Balance of Trade</b>, the difference between the stated money
  values of the exports and imports of a country. The balance is
  erroneously said to be 'in favour' of a country when the value of the
  exports is in excess of that of the imports, and 'against it' when the
  imports are in excess of the exports. The phrases date from the days of
  the mercantile system, the characteristic doctrine of which alleged the
  desirability of regulating commerce with a view to amassing treasure by
  exporting produce largely, importing little merchandise in return, and
  receiving the balance in bullion. In certain conceivable political and
  industrial conditions this may have had beneficial results; but its
  importance was greatly overestimated, and the state of this balance came
  to be regarded as an invariable criterion of the industrial condition of
  a country. The false analogy of the successful merchant who gains more
  than he spends became the basis of popular reasoning, the products of a
  country being mistakenly identified with its exports, its consumption
  with its importation. It is now generally recognized that if bullion be
  exported from a country it is because it is at the time the cheapest
  commodity available for export; and further, that there are certain
  natural limits to its undue exportation, in that the increased scarcity
  of money is attended with a fall in the money-value of other commodities,
  which thus in turn become preferable objects of exportation, while
  bullion flows back. The excess of the value of imports over that of
  exports, which is regarded by some as an adverse and alarming symptom in
  British trade, is in large part readily accounted for on the ground of
  shipping receipts, insurance returns, interest on capital employed in
  foreign trade, merchants' profits, and the income derived from foreign
  investments.</p>

  <p><b>Balbo´a</b>, Vasco Nuñez de, one of the early Spanish adventurers
  in the New World, born 1475. Having dissipated his fortune, he went to
  America, and was at Darien with the expedition of Francisco de Enciso in
  1510. An insurrection placed him at the head of the colony, but rumours
  of a western ocean and of the wealth of Peru led him to cross the
  isthmus. On 25th Sept., 1513, he saw for the first time the Pacific, and
  after annexing it to Spain, and acquiring information about Peru,
  returned to Darien. Here he found himself supplanted by a new governor,
  Pedrarias Davila, with much consequent grievance on the one side, and
  much jealousy on the other. Balboa submitted, however, and in the
  following year was appointed Viceroy of the South Sea. Davila was
  apparently reconciled to him, and gave him his daughter in marriage, but

  <p><b>Bal´cony</b>, in architecture, is a gallery projecting from the
  outer wall of a building, supported by columns or brackets, and
  surrounded by a balustrade. Balconies were not used in Greek and Roman
  buildings, and in the East the roof of the house has for centuries served
  similar purposes on a larger scale. Balconies properly so styled came
  into fashion in Italy in the Middle Ages, and were introduced into
  Britain in the sixteenth century.</p>

  <p><b>Balder</b>, or <b>Baldur</b>, a Scandinavian divinity, represented
  as the son of Odin and Frigga, beautiful, wise, amiable, and beloved by
  all the gods. His mother took an oath from every creature, and even from
  every inanimate object, that they would not harm Balder, but omitted the
  mistletoe. Balder was therefore deemed invulnerable, and the other gods
  in sport flung stones and shot arrows at him without harming him. But the
  evil god Loki fashioned an arrow from the mistletoe and got Balder's
  blind brother H&#x14D;der to shoot it, himself guiding his aim. Balder
  fell dead, pierced to the heart, to the deep grief of all the gods. He is
  believed to be a personification of the brightness and beneficence of the
  sun.</p>

  have written over a hundred works, most of which remain in MS. His works
  include a poem on <i>Navigation</i>, various translations and
  commentaries, <i>Lives of Celebrated Mathematicians</i>, &amp;c. He died
  in 1617.</p>

  <p><b>Baldness</b>, loss of the hair, complete or partial, usually the
  latter, and due to various causes. Most commonly it results as one of the
  changes belonging to old age, due to wasting of the skin, hair-sacs,
  &amp;c. It may occur as a result of some acute disease, or at an
  unusually early age, without any such cause. In both the latter cases it
  is due to defective nourishment of the hair, owing to lessened
  circulation of the blood in <!-- Page 364 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page364"></a>[364]</span>the scalp. The best treatment for
  preventing loss of hair seems to consist in such measures as bathing the
  head with cold water and drying it by vigorous rubbing with a rough towel
  and brushing it well with a hard brush. Various stimulating lotions are
  also recommended, especially those containing cantharides. But probably
  in most cases senile baldness is unpreventable. When extreme scurfiness
  of the scalp accompanies loss of the hair, an ointment that will clear
  away the scurf will prove beneficial.</p>

  though inferior to Dürer's, possessed many of the same characteristics,
  and on this account he has been sometimes considered a pupil of the
  Nuremberg master. His principal paintings are the series of panels (of
  the date 1516) over the altar in Freiburg Cathedral; others of his works

  <p><b>Baldwin I</b>, Emperor of Constantinople, founder of the
  short-lived dynasty of Latin sovereigns of the Eastern Empire, was born
  in 1172, and was hereditary Count of Flanders and Hainault. His courage
  and conduct in the fourth crusade led to his unanimous election as
  Emperor of the East after the capture of Constantinople by the French and
  Venetians in 1204. In the absence of Baldwin's brother with a large part
  of the army, the Greeks rose in revolt under the instigation of
  Joannices, King of Bulgaria. Baldwin marched on Adrianople, but was taken
  prisoner and died in captivity, 1205. Baldwin was succeeded by his
  brother Henry.&mdash;<b>Baldwin II</b>, fifth and last Latin Emperor of
  Constantinople, was born 1217. During his minority John de Brienne was
  regent, but on his assuming the power himself the Empire fell to pieces.
  In 1261 Constantinople was taken by the forces of Michael Palæologus, and
  Baldwin retired to Italy, dying in 1270.</p>

  <p><b>Baldwin I</b>, King of Jerusalem, reigned 1100-18, having assumed
  the title which his elder brother, Godfrey de Bouillon, had refused. He
  subdued Cæsarea, Ashdod, Tripolis, and Acre.&mdash;<b>Baldwin II</b>, his
  cousin and successor, reigned from 1118-31. During his reign the
  reduction of Tyre and institution of the order of Templars took
  place.&mdash;<b>Baldwin III</b>, King of Jerusalem from 1143 to 1162, was
  son and successor of Foulques of Anjou, and the embodiment of the best
  aspects of chivalry. After defeating Noureddin in 1152, and again in
  1157, he was enabled to devote himself to the hopeless task of improving
  the kingdom and establishing the Christian chivalry in the East. His
  death in 1162 was almost immediately followed by the total collapse of
  the kingdom.</p>

  <p><b>Baldwin</b>, James Mark, American philosopher, born in Columbia,
  12th Jan., 1861. He was educated at Princeton College, Leipzig and Berlin
  Universities; was instructor of German and French at Princeton College,
  1885-7; professor of philosophy in Lake Forest University, 1887-9;
  professor of psychology at Princeton University, 1893-1903. From 1903-9
  he was professor of philosophy and psychology at the Johns Hopkins
  University, Baltimore. Professor Baldwin is best known by his
  experimental psychology and his theories of genetic logic. He
  distinguishes between genetic logic, as theory of thought, and genetic
  philosophy, as theory of reality. Genetic sciences, according to Baldwin,
  are psychology, sociology, ethics, &amp;c., and his point of view he
  terms 'Æsthonomical Idealism'. Among his numerous works are: <i>Handbook
  of Psychology</i> (2 vols., 1891-2); <i>Mental Development in the Child
  and the Race</i> (3rd edition, 1906); <i>Social and Ethical
  Interpretations in Mental Development</i> (1904); <i>Thought and Things,
  or Genetic Logic</i> (1906-8). He also edited the <i>Dictionary of
  Philosophy and Psychology</i> (1901-9) and <i>The Psychological

  <p><b>Bale</b>, John, an English ecclesiastic, born in Suffolk in 1495,
  died in 1563. Although educated a Roman Catholic, he became a Protestant,
  and the intolerance of the Catholic party drove him to the Netherlands.
  On the accession of Edward VI he returned to England, was presented to
  the living of Bishop's Stoke, Southampton, and soon after nominated
  Bishop of Ossory, in Ireland. Here, on his preaching the reformed
  religion, the popular fury against him reached such a pitch that in one
  tumult five of his domestics were murdered in his presence. On the
  accession of Mary he lay some time concealed in Dublin, and after many
  hardships found refuge in Switzerland. At her death he was appointed by
  Elizabeth a prebend of Canterbury, where he died. His fame as an author
  rests upon his <i>Scriptorum Illustrium Majoris <!-- Page 365 --><span

  small islands, south-east of Spain, including Majorca, Minorca, Iviza,
  and Formentera. The popular derivation of the ancient name Baleares (Gr.
  <i>ballein</i>, to throw) has reference to the repute of the inhabitants
  for their skill in slinging, in which they distinguished themselves both
  in the army of Hannibal and under the Romans, by whom the islands were
  annexed in 123 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> After being taken by the
  Vandals, under Genseric, and in the eighth century by the Moors, they
  were taken by James I, King of Aragon, 1220-34, and constituted a
  kingdom, which in 1343 was united to Spain. The islands now form a

  for a ballet, <i>La Pérouse</i>, for the Scala at Milan, and in the
  following year sang at the Théâtre-Italien, Paris, with moderate success.
  He returned to Italy, and at Palermo was given his first opera, <i>I
  Rivali</i> (1829). For five years he continued singing and composing
  operas for the Italian stage. In 1835 he came to England, and composed a
  number of operas, amongst others <i>The Bohemian Girl</i> (1843), <i>The
  Rose of Castile</i> (1857), <i>Satanella</i> (1858), and <i>The
  Talisman</i> (first performed in 1874). He died 20th Oct., 1870. His

  25th July, 1848, and educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. He
  represented Hertford from 1874-5, East Manchester from 1885 to 1906, and
  has been representative for the City of London since 1906. For a time he
  was private secretary to his uncle, Lord Salisbury, under whom he was
  President of the Local Government Board, and afterwards Secretary for
  Scotland (1886-7), with a seat in the cabinet. He showed much firmness
  and ability as Chief Secretary for Ireland during Lord Salisbury's
  administration from 1887-91. He succeeded Rt. Hon. W.&nbsp;H. Smith as leader
  of the House of Commons and First Lord of the Treasury in 1891-2, and
  held the position again from 1895 till 1900, and from that year till
  1902. On the retirement of Lord Salisbury in 1902 he became Prime
  Minister, a position which he retained till Dec., 1905. Under him as
  Premier was passed the new English Education Act (which owed much to his
  personal influence and exertions), that for London, and the new Licensing
  Act, and he advocated a change of our fiscal policy, at least as far as
  having recourse to retaliation, denying that he in any way favoured
  protection. He became First Lord of the Admiralty in the Coalition
  Government of 1915, and Foreign Secretary in 1916. He was one of the
  British delegates to the Peace Conference in 1919. He is given to studies
  bearing on philosophy and religion, and has published a <i>Defence of
  Philosophic Doubt</i> (1879), <i>Essays and Addresses</i> (1893), <i>The
  Foundations of Belief</i> (1895), <i>Economic Notes on Insular
  Free-Trade</i> (1903), <i>Criticism and Beauty</i> (1909), <i>Theism and
  Humanism</i> (1915), &amp;c. He was President of the British Association

  Queen Mary, Lord of Session and member of the Privy Council. In 1567 he
  was appointed Governor of Edinburgh Castle, but had no scruple in
  surrendering it to Murray, who made him President of the Court of
  Session. He was charged with a share in the murder of Darnley, and helped
  to bring Regent Morton to his death. He died in 1583. <i>The Practicks of

  active in 1843 after a long period of quiescence. Principal products:
  rice, cocoa, coffee, indigo, cotton, &amp;c. The people are akin to those
  of Java and are mostly Brahmans in religion. It is divided into eight
  provinces under native rajahs, and since 1882 has formed one colony with

  <p><b>Bal´iol</b>, or <b>Balliol</b>, John de, of Barnard Castle,
  Northumberland, father of King John Baliol, a great English (or Norman)
  baron in the reign of Henry III, to whose cause he strongly attached
  himself in his struggles with the barons. In 1263 he laid the foundation
  of Balliol College, Oxford, which was completed by his widow Devorguila
  or Devorgilla. She was daughter and co-heiress of Allan of Galloway, a
  great baron of Scotland, by Margaret, eldest daughter of David, Earl of
  Huntingdon, brother of William the Lion. It was on the strength of this
  genealogy that his son John Baliol became temporary King of Scotland. He
  died 1269.</p>

  <p><b>Bal´iol</b>, or <b>Balliol</b>, John, King of Scotland, born about
  1249, died 1315. On the death of Margaret, the Maid of Norway and
  grandchild of Alexander III, Baliol claimed the vacant throne by virtue
  of his descent from David, Earl of Huntingdon, brother to William the
  Lion, King of Scotland (see above article). Robert Bruce (grandfather of
  the king) opposed Baliol; but Edward I's decision was in favour of
  Baliol, who did homage to him for the kingdom, 20th Nov., 1292. Irritated
  by Edward's harsh exercise of authority, Baliol concluded a treaty with
  France, then at war with England; but after the defeat at Dunbar he
  surrendered his crown into the hands of the English monarch. He was sent
  with his son to the Tower, but, by the intercession of the Pope in 1297,
  obtained liberty to retire to his Norman estates, where he
  died.&mdash;His son, Edward, in 1332 landed in Fife with an armed force,
  and, having defeated a large army under the Regent Mar (who was killed),
  got himself crowned king, but was driven out in three months.</p>

  <p><b>Bal´kan</b> (ancient, <b>Hæmus</b>), a rugged chain of mountains
  extending from Cape Emineh, on the Black Sea, in Eastern Roumelia,
  westwards to the borders of Serbia, though the name is sometimes used to
  include the whole mountain system from the Black Sea to the Adriatic, the
  region south of Austria and Russia, or south of the Danube and Save,
  forming the Balkan Peninsula. The range, which is over 200 miles in
  length, forms the water-shed between the streams flowing northward into
  the Danube and those flowing southward to the Ægean, the chief of the
  latter being the Maritza. The average height is not more than 5000 feet,
  but the highest point, Tchat-al-dagh, is 8340 feet. In the Russo-Turkish
  war of 1877-8 the Russian troops managed to cross it without great
  difficulty, though they had to encounter a stubborn resistance at the
  Shipka Pass, where a Turkish army of 32,000 men ultimately surrendered to
  them.</p>

  <p><b>Balkan League, The.</b> After the annexation of Bosnia and
  Herzegovina by Austria, in 1908, the Balkan League of Bulgaria, Serbia,
  Montenegro, and Greece was formed, apparently at the instigation of the
  Powers of the Triple Entente, primarily to constitute a bulwark against
  Austrian aggression towards the southeast. The League, however, directed
  its activities against Turkey, taking advantage of Turkish embarrassments
  in Libya and of the success of an insurrection in Albania to attempt in
  1912 the overthrow of the Turkish regime in Europe. The declaration of
  hostilities by the League in Oct., 1912, began the First Balkan War
  (q.v.). The League was maintained during the two <!-- Page 367 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page367"></a>[367]</span>campaigns of the war,
  but jealousy of Bulgarian pre-eminence led to its disruption in June,

  ally.</p>

  <p><b>Balkan War, The.</b> The First Balkan War (Oct., 1912-May, 1913)
  was the effort of the Balkan League (q.v.) to dismember Turkey in Europe.
  Each member of the League was allotted a definite strategic object, and
  each gained a considerable measure of success. Bulgaria defeated the
  Turks at Kirk Kilisseh and Lule Burgas, and drove them behind the lines
  of Tchataldja. The Greeks captured Salonica; the Serbians forced their
  way to the sea at Durazzo. The Montenegrins invested Scutari. An
  armistice in December was followed by indecisive negotiations, in which
  the Great Powers took part. Renewed hostilities in the spring of 1913
  (during which the Turks lost Adrianople) came to an end with the Treaty
  of London in May. Before its promises could be carried out, Serbia,
  Greece, and Roumania joined to crush Bulgaria in the Second Balkan War,
  alleging that her claims to conquered territory in Macedonia were
  excessive. The Treaty of Bucharest (Aug., 1913) finally concluded the
  war. The net results were: (1) to confine Turkey to Constantinople and
  the vilayet of Adrianople; (2) to extend Bulgarian territory to the Ægean
  and to increase greatly both Serbia and Montenegro; (3) to grant Salonica
  to Greece; (4) to create an autonomous Albania.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Balkh</b> (bälk or bäl<i>h</i>), a city in the north of
  Afghanistan, in Afghan Turkestan, at one time the emporium of the trade
  between India, China, and Western Asia. It was long the centre of
  Zoroastrianism, and was also an important Buddhist centre. In 1220 it was
  sacked by Genghis Khan, and again by Timur in the fourteenth century. The
  remains of the ancient city extend for miles. The town is now merely a
  village, but a new town has been built an hour's journey north of the
  old, the residence of the Afghan governor, with a pop. of about 20,000.
  The district, which formed a portion of ancient Bactria, lies between the
  Oxus and the Hindu-Kush, with Badakshan to the east and the desert to the
  west. In the vicinity of the Oxus, where there are facilities for
  irrigation, the soil is rich and productive, and there are many populous

  <p><b>Ball, Game of.</b> Ball-playing was practised by the ancients, and
  old and young amused themselves with it. The Phæacian damsels are
  represented in the <i>Odyssey</i> as playing it to the sound of music;
  and Horace represents Mæcenas as amusing himself thus during a journey.
  In the Greek gymnasia, the Roman baths, and in many Roman villas, a
  <i>sphæristerium</i> (a place appropriated for playing ball) was to be
  found; the games played being similar to those of the present day. In the
  Middle Ages the sport continued to be very popular both as an indoor and
  outdoor exercise, and was a favourite Court pastime until about the end
  of the eighteenth century. In England football and tennis are mentioned
  at an early date, and a favourite game prior to the English revolution
  was one in which a <i>mall</i> or mallet was used, hence the name
  <i>pall-mall</i> (It. <i>palla</i>, Lat. <i>pila</i>, a ball) for the
  game and the place where it was played. The most popular modern forms are
  cricket, base-ball, football, golf, lawn-tennis, fives, and polo.</p>

  <p><b>Bal´lad</b>, a term loosely applied to various poetic forms of the
  song type, but in its most definite sense a poem in which a short
  narrative is subjected to simple lyrical treatment. It was, as indicated
  by its name, which is related to the Low Latin <i>ballare</i> and O.
  French <i>baller</i>, to dance, originally a song accompanied by a dance.
  The ballad, like the nursery tales and the <i>Märchen</i>, is probably
  one of the earliest forms of rhythmic poetic expression, constituting a
  species of epic in miniature, out of which by fusion and remoulding
  larger epics were sometimes shaped. Their present form is, of course,
  relatively recent. As in the folk-tales, so in the ballads of different
  nations, the resemblances are sufficiently numerous and close to point to
  the conclusion that they have often had their first origin in the same
  primitive folk-lore or popular tales. But in any case, excepting a few
  modern literary ballads of a subtler kind, they have been the popular
  expression of the broad human emotions clustering about some
  strongly-outlined incidents of war, love, crime, superstition, or death.
  It is probable that in the Homeric poems fragments of older ballads are
  embedded; but the earliest ballads, properly so called, of which we have
  record were the <i>ballistea</i> or dancing-songs of the Romans, of the
  kind sung in honour of the deeds of Aurelian in the Sarmatic war by a
  chorus of dancing boys. In their less specialized sense of lyric
  narratives, their early popularity among the Teutonic race is evidenced
  by the testimony of Tacitus, of the Gothic historian Jornandes, and the
  Lombard historian Paulus Diaconus; and many appear to have been written
  down by order of Charlemagne and used as a means of education. Of the
  ballads of this period, however, only a general conception can be formed
  from their traces in conglomerates like the <i>Niebelungenlied</i>; the
  more artificial productions of the Minnesingers and Meistersingers
  overlying the more popular ballad until the fifteenth century, when it
  sprang once more into vigorous life. A third German ballad period was
  initiated by Bürger, under the inspiration of the revived interest in the
  subject shown in Great Britain and the publication of the Percy
  <i>Reliques</i>; and the movement was sustained by Herder, Schiller,
  Goethe, Heine, Uhland, and others. The earlier German work is, however,
  of inferior value to that of Scandinavia, where, though comparatively few
  manuscripts have survived, and those not more than three or four
  centuries old, a more perfect oral tradition has rendered it possible to
  trace the original stock of the twelfth century.</p>

  <p>Of the English and Scottish ballads anterior to the thirteenth century
  there are few traces beyond the indication that they were abundant, if
  indeed anything can be definitely asserted of them earlier than the
  fourteenth century. Among the oldest may be placed <i>The Little Gest of
  Robin Hood</i>, <i>Hugh of Lincoln</i>, <i>Sir Patrick Spens</i>, and the
  <i>Battle of Otterbourn</i>. In the fifteenth century specimens multiply
  rapidly: ballad-making became in the reign of Henry VIII a fashionable
  amusement, the king himself setting the example; and though in the reign
  of Elizabeth ballads came into literary disrepute and ballad singers were
  brought under the law, yet there was no apparent check upon the rate of
  their production. Except perhaps in the north of England and south of
  Scotland, there was, however, a marked and increasing tendency to
  vulgarization as distinct from the preservation of popular qualities. The
  value of the better ballads was lost sight of in the flood of dull,
  rhythmless, and frequently scurrilous verse. The modern revival in
  Britain dates from the publication of Allan Ramsay's <i>Evergreen</i> and
  <i>Tea-table Miscellany</i> (1724-7) and of the selection <i>Reliques</i>
  made by Bishop Percy from his seventeenth-century MSS. (1765), a revival
  not more important for its historic interest than for the influence which
  it has exercised upon all subsequent poetry.</p>

  <p>The threefold wave discernible in German, if not in British, ballad
  history, is equally to be traced in Spain, which alone among the
  Latinized countries of Europe has songs of equal age and merit with the
  British historic ballads. The principal difference between them is, that
  for the most part the Spanish romance is in trochaic, the British ballad
  in iambic metre. The ballads of the Cid date from about the end of the
  twelfth and beginning of the thirteenth century; and then followed an
  interval of more elaborate production, a revival of ballad interest in
  the sixteenth century, a new declension, and finally a modern and
  still-persisting enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>The French poetry of this kind never reached any high degree of
  perfection, the romance, farce, and lyric flourishing at the expense of
  the ballad proper. Of Italy much the same may be said, though Sicily has
  supplied a great store of ballads; and nearly all the Portuguese poetry
  of this kind is to be traced to a Spanish origin. The Russians have
  lyrico-epic poems, of which some, in old Russian, are excellent, and the
  Serbians are still in the ballad-producing stage of civilization. Modern
  Greece has also its store of ballads, published in several collections.
  In Greece, Russia, and elsewhere the old habit of improvising song as an
  accompaniment to dance still exists.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Ballade</b> (bal-a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>d´), the earlier and modern French
  spelling of <i>ballad</i>, but now limited in its use to a distinct
  verse-form introduced into English literature of late years from the
  French, and chiefly used by writers of <i>vers-de-société</i>. It
  consists of three stanzas of eight lines each, with an <i>envoy</i> or
  closing stanza of four lines. The rhymes, which are not more than three,
  follow each other in the stanzas thus: a, b, a, b; b, c, b, c, and in the
  envoy, b, c, b, c; and the same line serves as a refrain to each of the
  stanzas and to the envoy. There are other varieties, but this may be
  regarded as the strictest, according to the precedent of Villon and
  Marot.</p>

  <p><b>Bal´lantyne</b>, James, the printer of Sir Walter Scott's works,
  born at Kelso 1772, died at Edinburgh 1833. Successively a solicitor and
  a printer in his native town, at Scott's suggestion he removed to
  Edinburgh, where the high perfection to which he had brought the art of
  printing, and his connection with Scott, secured him a large trade. The
  printing firm of James Ballantyne &amp; Co. included Scott, James
  Ballantyne, and his brother John (who died in 1821). For many years he
  conducted the <i>Edinburgh Weekly Journal</i>. His firm was involved in
  the bankruptcy of Constable &amp; Co., by which Scott's fortunes were
  wrecked, but Ballantyne was continued by the creditors' trustee in the
  literary management of the printing-house. He survived Scott only about
  four months.</p>

  <p><b>Ballantyne</b>, Robert Michael, writer of books for boys, born at
  Edinburgh 1825, died in Rome 1894, was a nephew of James Ballantyne, the
  printer of Sir Walter Scott's works. He was for some years in North
  America in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company, and his experiences
  there supplied him with materials for some of his earlier books,
  especially <i>Hudson's Bay, or Life in the Wilds of North America</i>
  (1848); <i>The Young Fur Traders</i>; and <i>Ungava, a Tale of Eskimo
  Land</i>. For many years he continued to produce popular and instructive
  boys' books, dealing with scenes and subjects of the most varied kind;
  and he also published a volume entitled <i>Personal Reminiscences of
  Book-Making</i> (1893).</p>

  <p><b>Ballarat´</b>, or <b>Ballaarat</b>, an Australian town in Victoria,
  chief centre of the gold-mining industry of the colony, and next in
  importance to Melbourne, from which it is distant <span
  class="scac">W.N.W.</span> about 60 miles direct. It consists of two
  distinct municipalities, Ballarat West and Ballarat East, separated by
  the Yarrowee Creek, and has many handsome buildings, and all the
  institutions of a progressive and flourishing city, including hospital,
  mechanics' institute and library, free public library, Anglican and Roman
  Catholic cathedrals, &amp;c. Gold was first discovered in 1851, and the
  extraordinary richness of the field soon attracted hosts of miners. The
  surface diggings having been exhausted, the precious metal is now got
  from greater depths, and there are mines as deep as some coal-pits, the
  gold being obtained by crushing the auriferous quartz. There are also
  foundries, woollen mills, flour-mills, breweries and distilleries,

  in the water to such a depth as to enable it to carry sufficient sail
  without oversetting. (2) The sand placed in bags in the car of a balloon
  to steady it and to enable the aeronaut to lighten the balloon by
  throwing part of it out. (3) The material used to fill up the space

  <p><b>Bal´lentyne</b>, or <b>Bellenden</b>, John, a Scottish poet; was a
  native of Lothian, and appears to have been born towards the close of the
  fifteenth century. He was in the service of James V from the king's
  earliest years, and at his request he translated Boece's <i>Latin
  History</i>, which had been published at Paris in 1526, the translation
  being printed in 1536. As a reward he was made Archdeacon of Moray and a
  canon of Ross. He was a bitter opponent of the Reformation, and is said
  to have died at Rome in 1550.</p>

  <p><b>Ballet</b> (bal´&#x101;), a species of dance, usually forming an
  interlude in theatrical performances, but principally confined to opera.
  Its object is to represent, by mimic movements and dances, actions,
  characters, sentiments, passions, and feelings, in which several dancers
  perform together. The ballet is an invention of modern times, though
  pantomimic dances were not unknown to the ancients. The dances frequently
  introduced into operas seldom deserve the name ballet, as they usually do
  not represent any action, but are destined only to give the dancers an
  opportunity of showing their skill. The modern ballet was developed and
  perfected in France, and introduced into England in the eighteenth
  century. From an artistic point of view, the modern ballet is often a
  very low-class entertainment.</p>

  <p><b>Ballis´ta</b>, a machine used in military operations by the
  ancients for hurling heavy missiles, thus serving in some degree the
  purpose of the modern cannon. The motive power appears to have been
  obtained by the torsion of ropes, fibres, catgut, or hair. They are said
  to have sometimes had an effective range of a quarter of a mile, and to
  have thrown stones weighing as much as 300 lb. The ballistæ differed from
  the <i>catapultæ</i>, in that the latter were used for throwing
  darts.</p>

  <p><b>Ballis´tic Pendulum</b>, an apparatus for ascertaining the velocity
  of military projectiles, and consequently the force of fired gunpowder. A
  piece of ordnance is fired against bags of sand supported in a strong
  case or frame suspended so as to swing like a pendulum. The arc through
  which it vibrates is shown by an index, and the amount of vibration forms
  a measure of the force or velocity of the ball.</p>

  <p><b>Ballistics</b>, the science of the motion of projectiles.
  <i>Interior ballistics</i> deals with the motion of the shot while inside
  the gun, and with the results of the explosion of the charge. <i>Exterior
  ballistics</i> comprises a study of the trajectory or path of the
  projectile in the air, and the causes which affect the shape of this
  path, such as the density of the air, shape and weight of the shot,
  rifling of the barrel, angle of fire and speed of the projectile. If the
  air-resistance be neglected, it can be shown that the trajectory is a
  <i>parabola</i>. This result, given by Galileo, is of little use in
  gunnery except when taken along with a knowledge of air-resistance.
  Robins, in 1742, first measured the muzzle-speed of the shot by firing
  into a ballistic pendulum and noting the swing of the pendulum.
  Wheatstone, in 1840, suggested measuring the speed by causing the shot to
  cut successive wire screens, each of which formed part of an electric
  circuit. The Boulangé chronograph is a modern development of this idea.
  Rev. F. Bashforth's experiments, carried out between 1865 and 1880, form
  the basis of <!-- Page 371 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page371"></a>[371]</span>our knowledge of air-resistance. He found
  that the latter was proportional to the square of the diameter of the
  shot, and that, although the resistance is expressible in terms of a
  power of the speed, this power changes with the speed. The air-resistance
  is a maximum at about the speed at which sound travels, viz. 1100 feet
  per second. Artillerists employ ballistic tables based on the results
  obtained by Bashforth and others, by means of which, given the kind of
  projectile, its initial velocity, and angle of fire, they can calculate
  the range and time of flight of the projectile. See

  <p><b>Balloon-fish</b> (<i>Tetra&#x14F;don line&#x101;tus</i>), ord.
  Plectognathi, a curious tropical fish that can inflate itself so as to
  resemble a balloon.</p>

  <p><b>Balloons</b>, the most elementary form of lighter-than-air
  air-craft, unprovided with any means of propulsion or steering. Deriving
  its power of sustentation from the gas contained in the gas-bag, the free
  balloon is spherical in form. It is usually filled with coal-gas, which
  has a lifting-force of 35 lb. per 1000 cu. feet. Varying in size from
  5000 to 20,000 cu. foot capacity, the gas-bag is covered with a 'net',
  from which is hung the 'basket' for the accommodation of the aeronaut, or
  pilot, and passengers. The spherical gas-bag has at the bottom an
  elongation, known as the 'neck', which is open to the air in order that
  the gas may escape as it expands during the rise into the rarefied
  atmosphere of the upper air. A 'valve' is fitted at the top, which may be
  opened by a cord from the basket when it is desired to allow gas to
  escape in order to descend. Bags containing sand are carried in order
  that ballast may be dropped when it is desired to rise. A free balloon is
  completely at the mercy of the wind, and simply drifts where the wind
  takes it. Balloons are usually constructed of cotton fabric, though
  occasionally of gold-beater's skin, in which case they are commonly
  filled with hydrogen in place of coal-gas. A 'trail-rope' is usually
  carried, with which the practice of 'trailing' may be effected over open
  country or the sea. This consists in allowing the end of the trail-rope
  to drag on the ground. As the balloon rises it raises more of the rope
  off the ground, the additional weight bringing it down again. <i>Per
  contra</i>, as it falls the weight of the trail-rope is taken by the
  ground and so lightens the balloon. This tends to maintain the balloon at
  a uniform height. The greatest height ever attained by a balloon is
  37,000 feet, reached by Glaisher and Coxwell in Sept., 1862. Both
  aeronauts nearly perished from the effects of the cold and rarefaction of
  the atmosphere. In 1895 Parseval and Siegsfield, two officers of the
  Prussian army, invented the 'Drachen-ballon' or 'Kite-balloon' (Fr.
  <i>Saucisse</i>). This consists of a captive balloon comprising an
  elongated gas-bag fitted with an automatic air-chamber, or 'ballonet',
  for maintaining the pressure, and automatic stabilizers to prevent yawing
  off the wind, rolling from side to side, and pitching horizontally. This
  was improved upon by Captain Caquot of the French army, who in 1916
  produced an improved type, offering many advantages, which was used in
  large numbers by the British, French, and American armies and navies
  during the Great European War of 1914-8. See also <i>Aeronautics</i>,

  <p><b>Bal´lot, Voting by</b>, signifies literally voting by means of
  little balls (called by the French <i>ballottes</i>), usually of
  different colours, which are put into a box in such a manner as to enable
  the voter, if he chooses, to conceal for whom or for what he gives his
  suffrage. The method is adopted by most clubs in the election of their
  members&mdash;a white ball indicating assent, a black ball dissent.
  Hence, when an applicant is rejected, he is said to be
  <i>blackballed</i>. The term voting by ballot is also applied in a
  general way to any method of secret voting, as, for instance, when a
  person gives his vote by means of a ticket bearing the name of the
  candidate whom he wishes to support. In this sense vote by ballot is the
  mode adopted in electing the members of legislative assemblies in most
  countries, as well as the members of various other bodies. In ancient
  Greece and Rome the ballot was in common use. In Britain it had long been
  advocated in the election of members of Parliament and of municipal
  corporations, but it was only introduced by an Act passed in 1872.</p>

  strong aromatic scent; and the balm of Gilead of the shops, or balsam of
  Mecca or of Syria, is obtained from it by making an incision in its
  trunk. It has a yellowish or greenish colour, a warm, bitterish, aromatic
  taste, and an acidulous fragrant smell. It is valued as an odoriferous

  <p><b>Balsam</b>, an aromatic, resinous substance, flowing spontaneously
  or by incision from certain plants. A great variety of substances pass
  under this name. But in chemistry the term is confined to such vegetable
  juices as consist of resins mixed with volatile oils, and yield the
  volatile oil on distillation. The resins are produced from the oils by
  oxidation. A balsam is thus intermediate between a volatile oil and a
  resin. It is soluble in alcohol and ether, and capable of yielding
  benzoic acid. The balsams are either liquid or more or less solid; as,

  Its greatest depth is 126 fathoms; mean, 44 fathoms. A chain of islands
  separates the southern part from the northern, or Gulf of Bothnia. The
  water of the Baltic is colder and clearer than that of the ocean: it
  contains a smaller proportion of salt, and the ice obstructs the
  navigation three or four months in the year. Among the rivers that enter
  it are the Neva, Dwina, Oder, Vistula, and Niemen. Islands: Samsoe, Moen,
  Bornholm, Langeland, Laaland, which belong to Denmark (besides Zealand
  and Funen); Gottland and Oeland, belonging to Sweden; Rügen, belonging to
  Prussia; Dagoe and Oesel, belonging to Russia; and the Åland Islands. The
  Sound, the Great and the Little Belt lead from the Kattegat into the
  Baltic. The Baltic and North Sea were long connected by the Eider and a
  canal from it to the neighbourhood of Kiel, but this has been superseded
  by the great ship canal, starting from the Elbe near its mouth and ending
  in Kiel Bay.</p>

  <p><b>Bal´timore</b>, a city and port in Maryland, United States, finely
  situated on the <span class="scac">N.</span> side of the Patapsco, 14
  miles above Chesapeake Bay. Baltimore takes its name from Lord Baltimore,
  the founder of Maryland; it was first laid out as a town in 1729; and was
  erected into a city in 1797. It is well built, chiefly of brick, and is
  known as the 'monumental city', from the public monuments which adorn it,
  the principal being the Washington monument. Among its buildings are the
  city hall, built in Renaissance style, of white marble, with a tower and
  dome rising 240 feet; the Peabody Institute, containing a library, art
  gallery, &amp;c.; the Maryland Institute; the custom-house; the post
  office; the United States court-house and jail, the Johns Hopkins
  hospital, the Roman Catholic cathedral, &amp;c. The chief educational
  institution, now one of the most important in the States, is the Johns
  Hopkins University, endowed with 3,500,000 dollars by its founder (whose
  name it bears). There is a Roman Catholic archbishop with the rank of
  primate, and a Protestant episcopal bishop. Industries: shipbuilding;
  manufactures of iron, wool, cotton, pottery, &amp;c.; sugar-refining,
  distilling, tanning, the making of agricultural implements, canning
  oysters and fruits, &amp;c. As a flour market Baltimore is an important
  centre; and it does an immense trade in exporting tobacco and other
  products. The harbour is very extensive. Pop. (1920), 733,826.</p>

  <p><b>Baltimore</b>, George Calvert, Lord, born in Yorkshire about 1580,
  died in London 1632. He was for some time Secretary of State to James I,
  but this post he resigned in 1624 in consequence of having become a Roman
  Catholic. Notwithstanding this he retained the confidence of the king,
  who in 1625 raised him to the Irish peerage, his title being from
  Baltimore, a fishing-village of Cork. He had previously obtained a grant
  of land in Newfoundland, but as this colony was much exposed to the
  attacks of the French he left it, and obtained another patent for
  Maryland. He died before the charter was completed, and it was granted to
  his son Cecil, who deputed the governorship to his brother Leonard
  (1606-47).</p>

  <p><b>Baltimore Bird</b>, an American bird, the <i>Ict&#x115;rus
  Baltimorii</i>, family Icteridæ, nearly allied to the Sturnidæ, or
  starlings. It is a migratory bird, and is known also by the names of
  'golden robin', 'hang-bird', and 'fire-bird'. It is about 7 inches long;
  the head and upper parts are black, the under parts of a brilliant orange
  hue. It builds a pouch-like nest, very skilfully constructed of threads
  deftly interwoven, suspended from a forked branch and shaded by
  overhanging leaves. It feeds on insects, caterpillars, beetles, &amp;c.
  Its song is a clear, mellow whistle.</p>

  <p><b>Baluchistan</b> (ba-lö´chi-stän), a country in Asia, the coast of
  which is continuous with the north-western seaboard of India, bounded on
  the north by Afghanistan, on the west by Persia, on the south by the
  Arabian Sea, and on the east by Sindh. It has an area of about 135,000
  sq. miles, and a population estimated at 834,703. The general surface of
  the country is rugged and mountainous, with some extensive intervals of
  barren sandy deserts, and there is a general deficiency of water. Various
  kinds of grain are cultivated, and there is abundance of excellent
  fruits. The main body of the inhabitants are divided into two great
  branches, the Baluchis and Brahuis, differing in language, figure, and
  manners. The Baluchi language resembles the modern Persian, the Brahui
  presents points of agreement with the Dravidian languages of India. The
  Baluchis in general have tall figures, long visages, and prominent
  features; the Brahuis have shorter, thicker bodies, with round faces and
  rather flat features. Both races are Mahommedans, hospitable and brave.
  There are also many Afghans and others in the country. The Khan of
  Khelat, the nominal ruler of the whole land, in 1877 concluded a treaty
  with Britain, in virtue of which he became a feudatory of India. Since
  then Quetta, in the north-east, occupying an important position, and
  certain portions of territory, have been absolutely annexed, and in 1887
  a separate administration was constituted, and British authority
  established, under the Governor-General's agent. The area of British
  Baluchistan, including tribal areas, is 54,228 sq. miles; pop. 414,412.
  The country nominally under the Khan of Khelat has an area of 72,280 sq.
  miles; pop. 359,086. Under British administration roads and railways have
  been made, with telegraphs and a postal <!-- Page 374 --><span

  was librarian to M. de Colbert, and was appointed professor of canon law
  in the Royal College, but displeasing Louis XIV with his <i>Histoire
  Générale de la Maison d'Auvergne</i>, he was thrown into prison and his
  property confiscated. He recovered his liberty in 1713, but did not
  regain his position. He left some 1500 MSS. in the national library of
  Paris, besides forty-five printed works, including <i>Regum Francorum
  Capitularia</i> (2 vols.) and <i>Miscellanea</i> (7 vols.).</p>

  novelist, was born at Tours in 1799, died 1850. Before completing his
  twenty-fourth year he had published a number of novels under various
  assumed names, but the success attending all was very indifferent; and it
  was not till 1829, by the publication of <i>Le Dernier Chouan</i>, a tale
  of La Vendée, and the first novel to which Balzac appended his name, that
  the attention of the public was diverted to the extraordinary genius of
  the author. A still greater popularity attended his <i>Physiologie de
  Mariage</i>, a work full of piquant and caustic observations on human
  nature. He wrote a large number of novels, all marked by a singular
  knowledge of human nature and distinct delineation of character, but apt
  to be marred by exaggeration. Among his best-known works are: <i>Scènes
  de la Vie de Province</i>, <i>Scènes de la Vie Parisienne</i>, <i>Le Père
  Goriot</i>, <i>Eugénie Grandet</i>, and <i>Le Médecin de Campagne</i>.
  The publication of this last, in 1835, led to a correspondence between
  Balzac and the Countess Eveline de Hanska, a Polish lady whom, after
  about fifteen years, he visited and married. A collected edition of his
  works, under the title <i>La Comédie Humaine</i>, was published in 45
  vols., Paris, 1856-9, and another in 1869. In 1899 appeared the first

    Bamboo (<i>Bambusa arundinac&#x115;a</i>)
  </div>

  <p><b>Bamboo´</b>, the common name of the arborescent grasses belonging
  to the genus Bamb&#x16B;sa. There are many species, belonging to the
  warmer parts of Asia, Africa, and America, and growing from a few feet to
  as much as 100 feet, requiring much moisture to thrive properly. A
  peculiarity of the bamboo family is that they flower on reaching a
  certain age, generally about 130 years. <!-- Page 375 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page375"></a>[375]</span>The best-known species
  is <i>B. arundinac&#x115;a</i>, common in tropical and sub-tropical
  regions. From the creeping underground rhizome, which is long, thick, and
  jointed, spring several round jointed stalks, which send out from their
  joints several shoots, the stalks also being armed at their joints with
  one or two sharp rigid spines. The oval leaves, 8 or 9 inches long, are
  placed on short footstalks. The flowers grow in large panicles from the
  joints of the stalk. Some stems grow to 8 or 10 inches in diameter, and
  are so hard and durable as to be used for building purposes. The smaller
  stalks are used for walking-sticks, flutes, &amp;c.; and indeed the plant
  is used for innumerable purposes in the East Indies, China, and other
  Eastern countries. Cottages are almost wholly made of it; also, bridges,
  boxes, water-pipes, ladders, fences, bows and arrows, spears, baskets,
  mats, paper, masts for boats, &amp;c. The young shoots may be either
  pickled or salted and eaten with rice, or candied and preserved in sugar;
  the seeds of some species are also eaten. The substance called
  <i>tabasheer</i> is a siliceous deposit that gathers at the internodes of
  the stems. The bamboo is imported into Europe for various purposes, and
  is grown in British gardens.</p>

  annually delivered. The subjects prescribed are mainly connected with the
  evidences of Christianity, and the lecturer must have taken the degree of
  M.A. at Oxford or Cambridge. The first course of lectures was delivered
  in 1780, and they have been delivered every year since, with the
  exceptions of 1834, 1835, and 1841. Among the more remarkable lectures
  were those by Dr. White in 1784, by Dr. Mant in 1812, by Reginald Heber

  <p><b>Ban</b>, in political law, is equivalent to excommunication in
  ecclesiastical. In Teutonic history the <i>ban</i> was an edict of
  interdiction or proscription: thus, to put a prince under the ban of the
  empire was to divest him of his dignities, and to interdict all
  intercourse and all offices of humanity with the offender. Sometimes
  whole cities have been put under the <i>ban</i>, that is, deprived of
  their rights and privileges.</p>

  <p><b>Ban</b>, anciently, a title given to the military chiefs who
  guarded the eastern marches of Hungary; till 1919 the title of the

  is called <i>banat</i>, and is equivalent <!-- Page 376 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page376"></a>[376]</span>to the German term
  <i>mark</i>. During the European War, Serbia occupied the banat to the
  south of Hungary, and her claims to that region were disputed both by
  Hungary and Roumania. The territory is bounded almost entirely by the
  Danube, Theiss, and Maros Rivers, except on the east, where it is shut in
  by the Transylvanian Carpathians. The banat was ultimately divided

  <p><b>Bana´na</b>, a plant of the genus Musa, nat. ord. Musaceæ, being
  <i>M. sapientum</i>, while the plantain is <i>M. paradisi&#x103;ca</i>.
  It is originally indigenous to the East Indies, and an herbaceous plant
  with an underground stem. The apparent stem, which is sometimes as high
  as 30 feet, is formed of the closely-compacted sheaths of the leaves. The
  leaves are 6 to 10 feet long and 1 or more broad, with a strong midrib,
  from which the veins are given off at right angles; they are used for
  thatch, basket-making, &amp;c., besides yielding a useful fibre. The
  spikes of the flowers grow nearly 4 feet long, in bunches, covered with
  purple-coloured bracts. The fruit is 4 to 10 or 12 inches long, and 1
  inch or more in diameter; it grows in large bunches, weighing often from
  40 to 80 lb. The pulp is soft and of a luscious taste; when ripe it is
  eaten raw or cooked. The banana is cultivated in tropical and
  sub-tropical countries, and is the food of millions. It is estimated that
  in Jamaica alone 40,000 acres are devoted to its culture. Excellent
  biscuits may be made from banana meal, but it is not suitable for bread.
  Vast quantities are imported by Britain and the United States. Manila
  hemp is the product of a species of banana.</p>

  <p><b>Banking and Banks.</b> Banks are establishments for the deposit,
  custody, and repayment on demand of money, and obtain the bulk of their
  profits from the investment of sums thus derived and not in immediate
  demand. The term is a derivative of the <i>banco</i> or bench of the
  early Italian money-dealers, being analogous in its origin to the terms
  <i>trapez&#x12B;tai</i> (<i>trapeza</i>, a bench or table) applied to the
  ancient Greek money-changers, and <i>mensarii</i> (<i>mensa</i>, a table)
  applied to the public bankers of Rome.</p>

  <p>In respect of constitution there is a broad division of banks into
  public and private; public banks including such establishments as are
  under any special state or municipal control or patronage, or whose
  capital is in the form of stock or shares which are bought and sold in
  the open market; private banks embracing those which are carried on by
  one or more individuals without special authority or charter and under
  the laws regulating ordinary trading companies. In respect of function
  three kinds of banks may be discriminated: (1) banks of deposit merely,
  receiving and returning money at the convenience of depositors; (2) banks
  of discount or loan, borrowing money on deposit and lending it in the
  discount of promissory notes, bills of exchange, and negotiable
  securities; (3) banks of circulation or issue, which give currency to
  promissory notes of their own, payable to bearer and serving as a medium
  of exchange within the sphere of their banking operations. The more
  highly-organized banks discharge all three functions, but all modern
  banks unite the two first. For the successful working of a banking
  establishment certain resources other than the deposits are of course
  necessary, and the capital paid up by shareholders on their shares and
  forming the substantial portion of their claim to public credit is held
  upon a different footing from the sums received from depositors. It is
  usually considered that for sound banking this capital should not be
  traded with for the purpose of making gain in the same way as the moneys
  deposited in the bank; and it is for the most part invested in Government
  or other securities <!-- Page 380 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page380"></a>[380]</span>subject to little fluctuation in value and
  readily convertible into money. But in any case prudence demands that a
  <i>reserve</i> be kept sufficient to meet all probable requirements of
  customers in event of commercial crises or minor panics. The reserve of
  the banking department of the Bank of England is always in coin, or in
  notes against which an equivalent value of coin and bullion is lying in
  the issue department. In other English banks the reserve is usually kept
  partly in gold and partly in Government stocks and Bank of England notes;
  but it sometimes lies as a deposit in the Bank of England. The working
  capital proper of a bank is constituted by moneys on deposit, for which
  the bank may or may not pay interest; the advantages of security, of ease
  in the transmission of payments, &amp;c., being regarded in the cases of
  banks little affected by competition as a sufficient return to the
  depositor. Thus the Bank of England pays no interest on deposits, while
  the contrary practice has prevailed in Scotland since 1729, where
  interest is paid on deposits although not on current accounts.</p>

  <p>Of the methods of making profit upon the money of depositors, one of
  the most common is to advance it in the discounting of bills of exchange
  not having long periods (seldom more than three months with the Bank of
  England) to run; the banker receiving the amounts of the bills from the
  acceptors when the bills arrive at maturity. Loans or advances are also
  often made by bankers upon exchequer bills or other Government
  securities, on railway debentures or the stock of public companies of
  various kinds, as well as upon goods lying in public warehouses, the
  dock-warrant or certificate of ownership being transferred to the banker
  in security. In the case of a well-established credit they may be
  advanced upon notes of hand without other security. Money is less
  commonly advanced by bankers upon mortgages on land, in which the money
  loaned is almost invariably locked up for a number of years. To banks of
  issue a further source of profit is open in their note circulation,
  inasmuch as the bank is enabled to lend these notes, or promises to pay,
  as if they were so much money and to receive interest on the loan
  accordingly, as well as to make a profitable use of the money or property
  that may be received in exchange for its notes, so long as the latter
  remain in circulation. It is obvious, however, that this interest on its
  loaned notes may not run over a very extended period, in that the person
  to whom they are issued may at once return them to the bank to lie there
  as a deposit and so may actually draw interest on them from the bank of
  issue; or he may present them to be exchanged for coin, or by putting
  them at once into circulation may ensure a certain number speedily
  finding their way back through other hands or other banks to the
  establishment from which he received them. A considerable number of the
  notes issued will, however, be retained in circulation at the convenience
  of the public as a medium of exchange; and on this circulating portion a
  clear profit accrues. This rapid return of notes through other banks,
  &amp;c., in exchange for portions of the reserve of the issuing bank, is
  one of the restraints upon an issue of notes in excess of the ability of
  the bank to meet them. In the United Kingdom a more obvious restraint
  upon an unlimited note issue, originating partly in a desire for greater
  security, partly in the belief that the note augmentation of the currency
  might lead to harmful economic results in its influence upon prices, is
  to be found in the Bank Acts of 1844 and 1845, which impose upon banks of
  issue the necessity of keeping an equivalent in gold for all notes issued
  beyond a certain fixed amount. The wisdom of these legal restrictions,
  which are not uniform throughout the kingdom, and the desirability of the
  acquisition and control by the State of the whole business of issue, are
  still matters of debate.</p>

  <p>In specific relation to his customer the banker occupies the position
  of debtor to creditor, holding money which the customer may demand at any
  time in whole or in part by means of a cheque payable at sight on
  presentation during banking hours. For the refusal to cash a cheque from
  the erroneous supposition that he has no funds of his customer's in his
  hands, or for misleading statements respecting the position in which the
  bank stands, the banker is legally responsible. Moreover, the law regards
  him as bound to know his customer's signature, and the loss falls upon
  him in event of his cashing a forged cheque. In their relations to the
  community, the chief services rendered by banks are the following: By
  receiving deposits of money they are the means by which the surplus
  capital of one part of a country is transferred to another where it may
  be advantageously employed in stimulating industry; they enable vast and
  numerous money transactions to be carried on without the intervention of
  coin or notes at all, thus obviating trouble, risk, and expense. The
  mechanism by which the last of these benefits is secured is to be found
  in perfection in the London Clearing House.</p>

  <p>The modern tendency of banks is towards amalgamation. The large
  English banking institutions have absorbed many of the smaller banks.
  They have also made working arrangements with Scotch and Irish banks and
  with similar institutions abroad.</p>

  <p>The result of these amalgamations is to give control of immense
  financial resources to a smaller number of banks. In 1918 the <!-- Page
  381 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page381"></a>[381]</span>Government
  appointed a Committee to inquire into the effect of such amalgamations
  and absorptions. The terms of reference were: "To consider and report to
  what extent, if at all, amalgamations between banks may affect
  prejudicially the interests of the industrial and mercantile community,
  and whether it is desirable that legislation should be introduced to
  prohibit such amalgamations or to provide safeguards under which they
  might continue to be permitted"; and the Committee reported: "That
  legislation be passed requiring that the prior approval of the Government
  must be obtained before any amalgamations are announced or carried into
  effect".</p>

  <p>In order, however, that such legislation may not have the effect of
  producing secret amalgamations, the Committee decided that "all proposals
  for agreements which would alter the status of a bank as regards its
  separate entity and control, or for purchase by one bank of the shares of
  another bank, be also submitted for the prior approval of the Government
  before they are carried out".</p>

  <p>Another development is the registration of the British Overseas Bank,
  Limited, with a nominal capital of £5,000,000. The principal object of
  this institution is to carry on general banking business in all parts of
  the world. Four banks&mdash;two English, one Scotch, and one having
  connections with South America&mdash;are financially interested in the
  Overseas Bank.</p>

  <p>Banking operations on a considerable scale appear to have been
  conducted by the ancients, and recent excavations have proved that in the
  seventh century <span class="scac">B.C.</span> banking was practised at
  Bagdad by a firm of Egibi &amp; Sons. Modern banking, however, must be
  regarded as having had an independent origin in the reviving civilization
  of the Middle Ages. In the twelfth century almost the whole trade of
  Europe was in the hands of the Italian cities, and it was in these that
  the need of bankers was first felt. The earliest public bank, that of
  Venice, established in 1171 and existing down to the dissolution of the
  Republic in 1797, was for some time a bank of deposit only, the
  Government being responsible for the deposits, and the whole capital
  being in effect a public loan. In the early periods of the operations of
  this bank deposits could not be withdrawn, but the depositor had a credit
  at the bank to the amount deposited, this credit being transferable to
  another person in place of money payment. Subsequently deposits were
  allowed to be withdrawn, the original system proving inconvenient outside
  the Venetian boundaries. It is, however, less from the Bank of Venice
  than from the Florentine bankers of the thirteenth and fourteenth
  centuries that modern banking specially dates, the magnitude of their
  operations being indicated by the fact that between 1430 and 1433, 76
  bankers of Florence issued on loan nearly 5,000,000 gold florins. The
  Bank of St. George at Genoa also furnished a striking chapter in
  financial history. The important Bank of Amsterdam, taken by Adam Smith
  as a type of the older banks, was established in 1509, and owed its
  origin to the fluctuation and uncertainty induced by the clipped and worn
  currency. The object of the institution (established under guarantee of
  the city) was to give a certain and unquestionable value to a bill on
  Amsterdam; and for this purpose the various coins were received in
  deposit at the bank at their real value in standard coin, less a small
  charge for recoinage and expense of management. For the amount deposited
  a credit was opened on the books of the bank, by the transfer of which
  payments could be made, this so-called <i>bank money</i> being of uniform
  value as representing money at the mint standard. It bore, therefore, an
  <i>agio</i> or premium above the worn-coin currency, and it was legally
  compulsory to make all payments of 600 guilders and upwards in bank
  money. The deposits were supposed to remain in the coffers of the bank,
  but they were secretly traded with in the eighteenth century till the
  collapse of the bank in 1790. Banks of a similar character were
  established at Nuremberg and other towns, the most important being the
  Bank of Hamburg, founded in 1619. In England there was no corresponding
  institution, the London merchants being in the habit of lodging their
  money at the Mint in the Tower, until Charles I appropriated the whole of
  it (£200,000) in 1640. Thenceforth they lodged it with the goldsmiths,
  who began to do banking business in a small way, encouraging deposits by
  allowing interest for their use, lending money for short periods,
  discounting bills, &amp;c. The bank-note was first invented and issued in
  1690 by the Bank of Stockholm, founded by Palmstruck in 1688, and one of
  the most successful of banking establishments. About the same time the
  banks of England and Scotland began to take shape, opening up a new era
  in the financing of commerce and industry.</p>

  <p><i>Bank of England.</i>&mdash;The Bank of England, the most important
  banking establishment in the world, was projected by William Paterson,
  who was afterwards the promoter of the disastrous Darien scheme. It was
  the first public bank in the United Kingdom, and was chartered in 1694 by
  an Act which, among other things, secured certain recompenses to such
  persons as should advance the sum of £1,500,000 towards carrying on the
  war against France. Subscribers to the loan became, under the Act,
  stockholders, to the amount of their respective subscriptions, <!-- Page
  382 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page382"></a>[382]</span>in the
  capital stock of a corporation, denominated the <i>Governor and Company
  of the Bank of England</i>. The company thus formed advanced to the
  Government £1,200,000 at an interest of 8 per cent&mdash;the Government
  making an additional bonus or allowance to the bank of £4000 annually for
  the management of this loan (which, in fact, constituted the capital of
  the bank), and for settling the interest and making transfers, &amp;c.,
  among the various stockholders. This bank, like that of Venice, was thus
  originally an engine of the Government, and not a mere commercial
  establishment. Its capital has been added to from time to time, the
  original capital of £1,200,000 having increased to £14,553,000 in 1816,
  since which no further augmentation has taken place. There exists
  besides, however, a variable 'rest' of over £3,000,000. The charter of
  the bank was originally granted for eleven years certain, or till a
  year's notice after 1st Aug., 1705. It was subsequently renewed for
  various periods in 1697, 1708, 1713, 1742, 1764, 1781, 1800, 1833, and
  1844, certain conditions which the bank had to fulfil being specified at
  each renewal. On this last occasion it was continued till twelve months'
  notice from 1855. At the same time the issue department of the bank was
  established as distinct from the general banking department, the sole
  business entrusted to the former being the issue of notes. By this
  arrangement the bank was authorized to issue notes to the value of
  £14,000,000 upon securities specially set apart, the most important of
  the securities being the sum of £11,015,100 due to the bank by the
  Government, together with so much of the coin and bullion then held by
  the bank as was not required by the banking department. The bank has
  since been permitted to increase its issue on securities to £18,450,000,
  but for every note that the issue department may issue beyond the total
  sum of £18,450,000 an equivalent amount of coin or bullion must be paid
  into the coffers of the bank. For its special privileges the bank has to
  pay to the Government an annual sum of £180,000, and the profit derived
  from the issue of notes beyond £14,000,000. The Bank of England notes are
  practically equivalent to gold. They are (like all English bank-notes) of
  the value of £5 and upwards, and are legal tender throughout England.
  Notes once issued by the bank and returned to it are not reissued but are
  destroyed&mdash;a system adopted in order to facilitate the keeping of an
  account of the numbers of the notes in circulation, and so prevent
  forgery. On 7th Aug., 1914, Government notes for £1, and ten shillings,
  were issued convertible into gold at the Bank of England.</p>

  <p>In compliance also with the Bank Charter Act of 1844 the bank is
  compelled to publish a weekly account, of which the following is a
  specimen:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The total of the notes given out by the issue department is called the
  'issue circulation', the portion of it in the hands of the public being
  the 'active circulation', and that still in the banking department being
  the 'note reserve'. This 'note reserve' represents really the amount of
  bullion in the issue department available for the use of the banking
  department. Of the other items in the account it may be noted that the
  proprietors' 'rest' is a varying surplus increased always by accumulated
  profits up to 5th April and 10th Oct., when the bank dividends are paid
  to the shareholders; and that the public deposits, which include sums
  lodged on account of the customs, inland revenue, &amp;c., increase
  through revenue receipts until the dividend terms in January, April,
  July, and October. The other or private deposits comprise those of
  bankers, merchants, and other persons. An increase in these private
  deposits indicates an increase of monetary ease, while a decrease informs
  us that bankers, merchants, and traders have calls upon them for money. A
  better indication of the demand for money is furnished, however, by the
  advances on commercial securities, and it is by this and the condition of
  the reserve that the bank rate of discount is regulated. When the reserve
  is high and the advances moderate the discount rate is low, and it is
  raised according as the reserve falls and advances are more in request,
  especially during an adverse foreign exchange and drain of gold. Gold is
  thus restrained from going abroad, and its influx into <!-- Page 383
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page383"></a>[383]</span>the country is
  encouraged. In addition to the profit which the bank may make by ordinary
  banking business, by the Bank Act of 1892 and the Revenue Act of 1906, it
  receives an allowance for the management of the national debt, at the
  rate of £325 per million on 500 millions, and £100 per million on all
  debt above that sum. The annual sum is not to be less than £160,000. It
  also derives a profit from foreign gold coin and bullion brought to it,
  for which it pays £3, 17<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, or 1½<i>d.</i> per ounce
  less than the real value.</p>

  <p>The management of the bank is in the hands of a governor,
  deputy-governor, and twenty-four directors, elected by stock-holders who
  have held £500 of stock for six months previous to the election. A
  director is required to hold £2000, a deputy-governor £3000, and a
  governor £4000 of the stock. The court or board of directors meets every
  Thursday, when the weekly account is presented. The Bank of England has
  branches in Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Birmingham, Leeds, Hull,
  Bristol, Plymouth, and Portsmouth.</p>

  <p>The other English banks consist of numerous joint-stock and private
  banks in London and the provinces, many of the provincial establishments
  of both kinds having the right to issue notes. Private banks in London
  with not more than six partners have never been prevented from issuing
  notes, but they could not profitably compete with the Bank of England.
  The maximum issues of the provincial banks are limited to a certain
  amount, against which they are not compelled to hold gold in reserve, and
  they have no power to issue against specie in excess of the fixed
  circulation. Their actual issues are considerably below this amount. No
  union can take place between a joint-stock bank and a private bank, or
  between two joint-stock banks of issue, without one of them losing its
  issue. Their total authorized circulation is about £2,958,900, but the
  actual circulation of these banks is now only about £1,200,000, being
  distributed among about eighteen private and about twenty joint-stock
  banks. The notes of these banks are payable in Bank of England paper. The
  greater number of joint-stock banks are of limited liability, though
  their liability in respect of their notes is unlimited. Some of them have
  a large number of branches. All the joint-stock banks allow interest on
  money deposited with them. The total paid-up capital and reserves of the
  English joint-stock banks is about £100,000,000.</p>

  <p><i>Scotland</i>.&mdash;In Scotland there are no private banks, the
  only banks in that portion of the United Kingdom being eight joint-stock
  banks of issue, and their branches (the Mercantile and Savings not being
  banks of issue). By the Act of 1845 new banks of issue were prohibited, a
  monopoly being given to such establishments (nineteen in number) as
  existed in the year previous to 1st May, 1845. At the same time the issue
  of each was limited to the amount of its average circulation during that
  year, together with the specie held at the head office. Any bank issuing
  notes in excess of this limit is supposed to hold an equivalent amount of
  gold. The aggregate authorized circulation is now £2,676,350; the average
  actual circulation is fully £7,000,000. The Bank of Scotland, established
  by Act of Parliament in 1695, had for its original capital only £100,000,
  increased to £200,000 in 1744; but it now has a capital of £1,325,000
  paid up. It remained the only bank in Scotland till the Royal Bank of
  Scotland was established in 1727, with an original capital of £151,000,
  which has grown to £2,000,000 paid up. The British Linen Company was
  incorporated in 1746, for the purpose of promoting the linen manufacture,
  but soon became a general banking company; capital, £1,250,000 paid up.
  These three banks claim to be by their charters banks of limited
  liability. All the other Scottish banks have been established within the
  nineteenth century. They are all incorporated by royal charter or Act of
  Parliament, which enables them to sue and be sued as a corporation, and
  latterly they have all become banks of limited liability, except that
  their liability is not to be limited in respect to their note issue. The
  total paid-up capital of the Scotch banks is £9,300,000. A large number
  of one-pound notes circulate in Scotland, thus tending to keep the
  requirements for gold low. From allowing a moderate rate of interest on
  deposit accounts (although not on current accounts) it is not uncommon
  for depositors in Scottish banks to lodge their money permanently as an
  investment; and the habit of keeping an account with a banker is much
  more general in Scotland than in England, branch offices of the banks
  being very numerous. Several of the Scotch banks have branch offices in
  London, but of course they cannot issue their own notes from these
  offices. The Scotch banks have enjoyed a high reputation for stability,
  and though public confidence was somewhat shaken by the failure of the
  Western Bank in 1857, and even more rudely by that of the City of Glasgow
  Bank in 1878, their shares are generally looked upon as a safe and
  remunerative investment. Their total deposits amount to fully
  £107,000,000.</p>

  <p><i>Ireland.</i>&mdash;The banks in Ireland consist of one public or
  national bank, the Bank of Ireland, and of sundry joint-stock and private
  banks. The authorized note circulation is arranged on the same footing as
  that of the Scotch banks. If any bank discontinues its issue and issues
  notes of the Bank of Ireland, the circulation of <!-- Page 384 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page384"></a>[384]</span>the latter may be to an
  equal amount increased. The authorized circulation is £6,354,494; the
  actual circulation is sometimes a little above, sometimes a little below.
  The Bank of Ireland, which was established by charter in 1783 with
  similar privileges to those granted to the Bank of England, has lent the
  greater portion of its capital to Government. Its capital is £2,769,230
  (or £3,000,000 Irish); it has also a rest or reserve of over £1,000,000.
  The bank allows interest on deposits when lodged for a stated period.</p>

  <p><i>Banque de France.</i>&mdash;The Bank of France is second in
  importance only to the Bank of England. It was established in the
  beginning of the nineteenth century, at first with a capital of
  45,000,000 francs, and with the exclusive privilege in Paris of issuing
  notes payable to bearer, a privilege which was extended in 1848 to cover
  the whole of France. It has numerous branches in the larger towns, a
  number of these having been acquired in 1848, when certain joint-stock
  banks of issue were by Government decree incorporated with the Bank of
  France, the capital of which was then increased to 91,250,000 francs
  (£3,650,000), in 91,250 shares of 1000 francs each. In 1857 the capital
  was doubled, and besides this it has a large surplus capital or rest.
  Like the Bank of England, it is a bank of deposit, discount, and
  circulation, and is a large creditor of the State. The Government
  appoints the governor and the two deputy-governors, who are all required
  to be stockholders. There is also a body of fifteen directors and three
  censors, nominated by the shareholders. The value of its note circulation
  in March, 1922, was 36,225,852,000 francs.</p>

  <p><i>British Colonies.</i>&mdash;With regard to the banks in British
  colonies little need be said. All the more important are joint-stock
  concerns, and they are carried on subject to Acts passed by the
  respective colonial legislatures. Some of them have their head-quarters
  in London, and have been established by English capital. In Canada the
  banks are not allowed to issue notes of lower denominations than five
  dollars, notes for one and two dollars and higher amounts being issued by
  the Dominion Government; and the banking laws are such that there is no
  possibility of holders of bank-notes being losers by them. The total
  paid-up capital of the Canadian banks is about £20,000,000; their total
  deposits about £135,000,000.</p>

  <p><i>United States.</i>&mdash;The more important of the banks of the
  United States are what are called national banks, established in
  accordance with an Act passed in 1863. Associations of this kind at
  starting must invest at least a third of their paid-up capital in
  Government bonds, which pay them an interest of 4 per cent more or less.
  They then obtain from the Government bureau, established for the purpose,
  90 per cent of paper-money sheets, which they sign and pay out, this
  constituting their note circulation. These banks pay no interest to
  depositors. Besides the notes of these banks a large portion of the
  currency of the United States consists of Government notes issued from
  the national treasury. There are also banks chartered by the different
  States and private banks.</p>

  <p><i>Savings-banks</i> are banks established for the receiving of small
  sums, so as to be taken advantage of by the poorer classes, and they are
  carried on entirely for the benefit of the depositors. They are of
  comparatively recent origin, one of the earliest having been an
  institution in which small sums were received, and interest allowed on
  them, established by Mrs. Priscilla Wakefield, at Tottenham, near London,
  in 1803. The first savings-bank in Scotland was formed in 1810 by the
  Rev. Henry Duncan, of Ruthwell, Dumfriesshire. In 1814 the Edinburgh
  savings-bank was established on the same principles, and the system soon
  spread over the kingdom. The first Act relating to savings-banks was
  passed in 1817. By it all deposits in savings-banks, as soon as they
  reached £50, were placed in the hands of the National Debt Commissioners,
  who allowed interest on them. In 1824 it was enacted that the deposits
  for the first year should not exceed £50, nor those in subsequent years
  £30, the total deposits being limited to £150, and interest ceasing to be
  paid when accrued interest made the total £200. By the Act of 1893 the
  limit of annual deposit was raised to £50, and the interest is now rather
  less than 3 per cent. An Act of 1833 had provided for the purchase of
  Government annuities by depositors either for life or for a term of
  years; and an annuity of any amount up to £100 may now be obtained.
  Depositors in savings-banks (by an Act of 1880) can also have their money
  invested for them in Government stock, the banks collecting and paying
  the dividends; and when accrued interest raises an account above £200 the
  excess is now so invested for the depositor. The total amount invested by
  one person in Government stock is not to exceed £500, nor £200 in one
  year. These banks are managed by local trustees having no personal
  interest in the business, and by certain paid officers. A new class of
  savings-banks, namely, <i>Post Office Savings-banks</i>, was established
  in Britain in connection with the money-order department of the Post
  Office in 1861. Any sum not less than a shilling is received, provided
  that the total amount banked does not exceed £50 in one year, or more
  than £200 in all; the excess of accrued interest above this being
  invested in Government stock. Interest is paid on every complete pound at
  the rate of 2½ per cent. For the deposits the Government is <!-- Page 385
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page385"></a>[385]</span>responsible,
  and they may be drawn from any Post Office Savings-bank in the kingdom.
  These savings-banks have become very numerous, and much of the funds
  formerly in the trustees' savings-banks has been transferred to them. The
  total amount deposited in the old banks is now about £52,000,000, in the
  new about £157,600,000. The regulations regarding the purchase of
  Government stock and annuities correspond with those given above.
  Savings-banks are now well known in all civilized countries, and the good
  they have done is incalculable. In the United States there is an enormous
  amount of money deposited in them. Post Office Savings-banks have been
  proposed to be established in the States, but have not yet been so. In
  Canada, Australia, and other British colonies they are established, as
  well as savings-banks of several other kinds. School savings-banks are
  the most recent institutions of this kind, and have had a marked effect
  for good.</p>

  <p><b>Bankrupt</b> (from It. <i>banca rotta</i> 'bank broken' or 'bench
  broken'. Dr. Johnson said that the word originated from the Italian
  custom of breaking the bench of an insolvent money-changer; but
  <i>rotta</i> also means 'interrupted' or 'stopped', and is here used more
  in the sense of our colloquial word <i>broken</i>, and means
  'insolvent'), a person whom the law does or may take cognizance of as
  unable to pay his debts. Properly it is of narrower signification than
  <i>insolvent</i>, an insolvent person simply being unable to pay all his
  debts. In England up till 1861 the term <i>bankrupt</i> was limited to an
  insolvent trader, and such traders were on a different footing from other
  insolvent persons, the latter not getting the same legal relief from
  their debts. In all civilized communities laws have been passed regarding
  bankruptcy. At present bankruptcy in England is regulated by the
  Bankruptcy Acts of 1883 and 1890, which have as one chief feature the
  intervention of the Board of Trade in the proceedings, with the object of
  obtaining full official supervision and control. A bankruptcy petition
  may be presented either by a creditor or a debtor. A creditor's petition
  must be founded on a debt of not less than fifty pounds, due to one or
  more creditors, and on an 'act of bankruptcy' committed by the debtor
  within three months before the presentation of the petition. A debtor
  commits an act of bankruptcy if he makes a conveyance of his property to
  a trustee for the benefit of his creditors; if he makes a fraudulent
  transfer of any part of his property; if, to defeat or delay his
  creditors, he conceal himself either at home or abroad; if execution
  issued against him has been enforced by seizure and sale of his goods
  under process in an action in any court; if he files in court a
  declaration of inability to pay his debts, or presents a bankruptcy
  petition against himself; if a creditor has obtained a final judgment
  against him for any amount and he fail to pay the judgment debt without
  satisfactory reason; or if the debtor gives notice to any of his
  creditors that he has suspended, or is about to suspend, payment of his
  debts. In London jurisdiction in bankruptcy now rests with the High Court
  of Justice, while the county courts continue to have jurisdiction in
  bankruptcy outside the London district. When the court is satisfied as to
  the petition, a 'receiving order' is issued to protect the debtor's
  estate by constituting the official appointed by the Board of Trade
  receiver of the debtor's property, and to stay the remedies of all
  creditors until the meeting of creditors. The debtor must make out a full
  statement of his affairs, accounting as best he can for his insolvency.
  The official receiver summons the meeting of creditors, a summary of the
  debtor's affairs being sent to each creditor with the notice of the
  meeting, which is also advertised in the <i>London Gazette</i>. The
  creditors must send to the official receiver, one day before the meeting,
  sworn proofs of their claims to enable them to vote. At the meeting the
  creditors (unless the debtor's proposal for a composition or scheme be
  entertained) pass a resolution adjudging the debtor bankrupt, and appoint
  a trustee of the bankrupt's property, with a committee of inspection
  selected from their own body to superintend the administration of the
  bankrupt's property by the trustee, who divides the available realized
  assets amongst all creditors who have sent sworn proofs of claims. Rates,
  assessments, and taxes, and all wages or salary of a clerk, servant,
  labourer, or workman during four months before the date of the receiving
  order not exceeding £50 are paid in priority to all other debts. The
  trustee is required to give satisfactory security to the Board of Trade,
  by which his accounts are audited not less than twice in each year. All
  moneys received by the trustee under the bankruptcy must be paid
  forthwith to an account kept at the Bank of England by the Board of
  Trade, called the 'Bankruptcy Estates Account'. The debtor is bound to be
  publicly examined upon oath in court, and any creditor who has tendered a
  proof, or his representative, may take part in the examination. Until the
  debtor has passed his public examination he cannot apply for an order of
  discharge, and upon proof of misdemeanour the court refuses or <!-- Page
  386 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page386"></a>[386]</span>suspends
  the discharge. A discharged bankrupt is disqualified for five years from
  acting as member of Parliament, justice of peace, alderman, overseer of
  the poor, county councillor, or as a member of any school, highway, or
  burial board. An undischarged bankrupt obtaining credit to the extent of
  £20 or upwards from any person, without informing such person of his
  status, is guilty of a misdemeanour. By the Act of 1883 the creditors may
  at the first meeting resolve to entertain a proposal for a composition or
  scheme of arrangement of the debtor's affairs, but the composition or
  scheme shall not be binding on the creditors, unless confirmed at a
  second meeting by a majority in number representing three-fourths in
  value of all the creditors who have proved. The composition or scheme has
  then to be formally brought before the court for approval, which may be
  refused. A composition or scheme may be sanctioned by the court after the
  debtor's adjudication as a bankrupt, and in this case the bankruptcy is
  annulled. Though imprisonment for debt has been abolished, fraudulent
  bankrupts may be punished, and the conduct of prosecutions for offences
  arising out of any bankruptcy proceeding falls to the public prosecutor.
  The estates of persons dying insolvent may be administered according to
  the law of bankruptcy. The Act of 1913 embodies suggestions of the
  Bankruptcy Law Amendment Committee of 1906. Thus, the Summary
  Jurisdiction Act can now be applied to offenders under the Debtors' Act.
  Whereas previously conviction for such offences as failure to keep proper
  accounts and concealment of debt could only be by trial before a jury,
  they are punishable after summary trial before a stipendiary magistrate
  or justice of the peace, the onus of proving innocence falling on the
  debtor. A married woman, too, may be made bankrupt even if not trading
  separately from her husband.</p>

  <p>According to Scots law bankruptcy is notorious insolvency, that is, a
  public acknowledgment of inability to discharge obligations. By a
  judicial proceeding, called <i>sequestration</i>, authorized by the Court
  of Session or sheriff court, on the petition of the debtor himself with
  the concurrence of one creditor swearing to a debt of £50, two whose
  debts together amount to £70, or of any number of creditors whose debts
  together amount to £100; or on the petition of a creditor or creditors to
  the foregoing extent without the concurrence of the debtor, if he has
  clearly shown himself to be insolvent (or a <i>notour bankrupt</i>), the
  whole estates and effects of the debtor, real and personal, are legally
  taken for behoof of the creditors. The debtor's estate is then made over
  to a trustee chosen by the creditors, the trustee being charged to bring
  the whole estate into the form of money, with certain precautions, and to
  receive, investigate, and reject or admit the claims of the creditors,
  subject to review of the Court of Session or sheriff court by summary
  petition. The debtor, and all who can give information as to the estate,
  must submit to public examination on oath before the sheriff of the
  county, and the debtor may thereafter, or by petition after six, twelve,
  or eighteen months from sequestration, be discharged of all debts by the
  court with consent of the creditors or a number of them, or at the expiry
  of two years without consent. These proceedings may be partly superseded
  by 'composition' if such be assented to by a majority in number and
  nine-tenths in value of creditors, or by a majority in number and
  four-fifths in value of the creditors, according to the period at which
  such arrangement may be proposed. They may also be terminated by a deed
  of arrangement entered into between the bankrupt and a majority in number
  and four-fifths in value of his creditors, approved of by the court.
  Before a discharge is given there must be a report from the trustee as to
  the conduct of the bankrupt, whether he has complied with the provisions
  of the Act, whether his bankruptcy is culpable or not, &amp;c. Before the
  abolition of imprisonment for ordinary civil debts by Act passed in 1880,
  an insolvent debtor often took advantage of a form of process by which,
  on making a complete <i>cessio bonorum</i>, or surrender to his creditors
  of all his property, he might obtain protection from imprisonment. Though
  no person can now be imprisoned for ordinary debts, a creditor of a
  <i>notour</i> bankrupt may present a petition to the sheriff, praying him
  to decern that the debtor assign over all his goods for behoof of his
  creditors and that a trustee be appointed; and this proceeding is still
  designated a process of <i>cessio bonorum</i>. The Act of 1880 also
  provides for the better punishment of fraudulent debtors in Scotland. If
  the debtor's liabilities exceed £200, the sheriff may award
  <i>sequestration</i> of the debtor's estate instead of <i>cessio
  bonorum</i>. There is no appeal from the sheriff's decision with respect
  to discharge.</p>

  <p>In Ireland there is a special code of bankruptcy contained in special
  Acts, differing to some extent from the regulations prevailing both in
  England and Scotland. Thus in Ireland it is not an offence for an
  undischarged bankrupt to obtain credit to any amount without disclosing
  the fact of his bankruptcy. All bankruptcy business comes before the
  court at Dublin, Belfast, or Cork. Imprisonment for debt was abolished in
  1872.</p>

  <p><b>Banks</b>, Sir Joseph, Baronet, a distinguished naturalist, born in
  London 1743. After studying at Harrow and Eton he went to Oxford in 1760,
  and formed there amongst his fellow-undergraduates a voluntary class in
  botany, &amp;c. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1766, and
  soon after went to Newfoundland and Hudson's Bay to collect plants. In
  1768, with Dr. Solander, a Swedish gentleman, pupil of Linnæus, and then
  assistant librarian at the British Museum, he accompanied Cook's
  expedition as naturalist. In 1772 he visited Iceland along with Dr.
  Solander, and during this voyage the Hebrides were examined, and the
  columnar formation of the rocks of Staffa first made known to geologists.
  In 1777 Banks was chosen President of the Royal Society, and in 1781 was
  made a baronet, and in 1795 received the Order of the Bath. He wrote only
  essays, papers for learned societies, and short treatises. He died in
  1820, and bequeathed his collections to the British Museum.</p>

  <p><b>Banks</b>, Thomas, an English sculptor, born in 1735, died in 1805.
  He studied sculpture in the Royal Academy, where he obtained the gold
  medal for a bas-relief of the <i>Rape of Proserpine</i>. In 1772 he went
  to Italy, where he executed several excellent pieces, particularly
  <i>Cupid tormenting a Butterfly</i>, which was afterwards purchased by
  the Empress Catherine. On leaving Italy he spent two unsatisfactory years
  in Russia, and then returned to England, where he was soon after made an
  Academician. One of his best-known works is <i>Shakespeare attended by
  Painting and Poetry</i>. Among his other works was a colossal
  statue&mdash;<i>Achilles mourning the loss of Briseis</i>&mdash;in the
  hall of the British Institution, and the monument of Sir Eyre Coote in
  Westminster Abbey. His bust of Warren Hastings is in the National
  Gallery.</p>

  <p><b>Ban´yan</b> (<i>Ficus benghalensis</i>), a tree of India, of the
  fig genus. The most peculiar feature of this tree is its method of
  throwing out from the horizontal branches supports which take root as
  soon as they reach the ground, enlarge into trunks, and, extending
  branches in their turn, soon cover a prodigious extent of ground. A
  celebrated banyan tree has been known to shelter 7000 men beneath its
  shade. The wood is soft and porous, and from its white glutinous juice
  bird-lime is sometimes prepared. Both juice and bark are regarded by the
  Hindus as valuable medicines, and the tree itself is sacred. The banyan
  tree is described by Southey in his poem <i>The Curse of Kehama</i>.</p>

    Baobab or Monkey-bread Tree (<i>Adansonia digitata</i>)
  </div>

  <p><b>Ba´obab</b> (<i>Adansonia digit&#x101;ta</i>) or <b>Monkey-bread
  Tree</b>, a tree belonging to the nat. ord. (or sub-ord.) Bombaceæ, and
  the best-known species of its genus, which was named after the naturalist
  Adanson. Though not tall, it is one of the bulkiest of trees, its trunk
  sometimes measuring 30 feet in diameter, and as the profusion of leaves
  <!-- Page 389 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page389"></a>[389]</span>and drooping boughs sometimes almost hides
  the stem, the whole forms a hemispherical mass of verdure 140 to 150 feet
  in diameter and 60 to 70 feet high. It is a native of the African
  savannahs, and is cultivated in many of the warmer parts of the world.
  The roots are of extraordinary length, a tree 77 feet in girth having a
  tap-root 110 feet in length. The leaves are deep green, divided into five
  unequal parts lanceolate in shape, and radiating from a common centre.
  The flowers resemble the white poppy, having snowy petals and
  violet-coloured stamens; and the fruit, which is large and of an oblong
  shape, is said to taste like gingerbread, with a pleasant acid flavour.
  The wood is pale-coloured, light, and contains a large store of water,
  which enables the tree to withstand prolonged drought. The tree is liable
  to be attacked by a fungus which, growing in the woody part, renders it
  soft and pithlike. By the negroes of the west coast these trunks are
  hollowed into chambers, and dead bodies are suspended in them. There they
  become perfectly dry and well preserved, without further preparation or
  embalming. The baobab is emollient and mucilaginous; the pulverized
  leaves constitute <i>lalo</i>, which the natives mix with their daily
  food.</p>

  <p><b>Bapaume</b>, a French town in the department of Pas-de-Calais. It

  one of the most closely-contested battles was fought there on 3rd Jan.,
  1871. Bapaume, occupied by the Germans in the European War, was
  recaptured by British troops on 29th Aug., 1918, the great battle of
  Bapaume having begun on 21st Aug. Pop. (1911) 2917.</p>

  <p><b>Baph´omet</b>, the imaginary idol or symbol which the Templars were
  accused of employing in their mysterious rites, and of which little is

  the Templars were accused of having a leaning. See <i>Gnosticism</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Baptism</b> (from the Gr. <i>baptiz&#x14D;</i>, from
  <i>bapt&#x14D;</i>, to immerse or dip), a rite which is generally thought
  to have been usual with the Jews even before Christ, being administered
  to proselytes. All that can be said, however, with some certainty is that
  the Jewish baptism was not of later origin than the Christian baptism.
  Anyhow, from this baptism that of St. John the Baptist differed, because
  he baptized Jews also as a symbol of the necessity of perfect
  purification from sin. Christ himself never baptized, but directed his
  disciples to administer this rite to converts (<i>Mat.</i> xxviii, 19);
  and baptism, therefore, became a religious ceremony among Christians,
  taking rank as a sacrament with all sects which acknowledge sacraments.
  It should, however, be borne in mind that among many peoples a rite is
  found which has considerable likeness to Christian baptism. In the
  primitive Church the person to be baptized was dipped in a river or in a
  vessel, with the words which Christ had ordered, generally adopting a new
  name further to express the change. Sprinkling, or, as it was termed,
  <i>clinic</i> baptism, was used only in the case of the sick who could
  not leave their beds. The Greek Church and Eastern schismatics retained
  the custom of immersion; but the Western Church adopted or allowed the
  mode of baptism by pouring or sprinkling, since continued by most
  Protestants. This practice can be traced back certainly to the third
  century, before which its existence is disputed. Since the Reformation
  there have been various Protestant sects called Baptists, holding that
  baptism should be administered only by immersion, and to those who can
  make a personal profession of faith. The Montanists in Africa baptized
  even the dead, and in Roman Catholic countries the practice of baptizing
  church bells&mdash;a custom of tenth-century origin&mdash;continues to
  this day. Being an initiatory rite, baptism is only administered once to
  the same person. The Roman and Greek Catholics consecrate the water of
  baptism, but Protestants do not. The act of baptism is accompanied only
  with the formula that the person is baptized in the name of the Father,
  Son, and Holy Ghost; but, among most Christians, it is preceded by a
  confession of faith made by the person to be baptized if an adult, and by
  his parents or sponsors if he be a child. The Roman Catholic form of
  baptism is far more elaborate than the Protestant. This Church teaches
  that all persons not baptized are damned, and that even unbaptized
  infants are not admitted into Heaven; but for those whose chief fault was
  that they had not been baptized, even St. Augustine himself believed in a
  species of mitigated damnation. Protestants hold that though the neglect
  of the sacrament is a sin, yet the saving new birth may be found without
  the performance of the rite which symbolizes it. Naming the person
  baptized forms no essential part of the ceremony, but has become almost
  universal, probably from the ancient custom of renaming the
  catechumen.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: E.&nbsp;B. Tylor,

    Baptistery of S. Giovanni in Laterano, Rome
  </div>

  <p><b>Bap´tistery</b>, a building or a portion of a building in which is
  administered the rite of baptism. In the early Christian Church the
  baptistery was <!-- Page 390 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page390"></a>[390]</span>distinct from the basilica or church, but
  was situated near its west end, and was generally circular or octagonal
  in form, and dome-roofed. About the end of the sixth century the
  baptistery began to be absorbed into the church, the font being placed
  within and not far from the western door. Some detached baptisteries
  still remain in use, as those of the Lateran, Rome (the earliest in
  existence), at Pisa, Parma, Ravenna, Aquileia, Siena, Florence, &amp;c.,
  that of Florence being 108 feet in diameter externally, and richly
  decorated. Baptisteries were dedicated to St. John the Baptist.</p>

  <p><b>Bap´tists</b>, a Protestant sect, distinguished by their opinions
  respecting the mode and subjects of baptism. With regard to the mode,
  they maintain the necessity of immersion, and with regard to the
  subjects, they consider that baptism ought not to be administered to
  children at all, nor to adults in general, but to those only who profess
  repentance and faith. They are sometimes called <i>Anti-pædobaptists</i>,
  to express their variance from those who defend infant baptism, and who
  are called <i>Pædobaptists</i>. Apart from the special sect of that name,
  Baptists are to be found equally among Calvinists and Arminians,
  Trinitarians and Unitarians. The Baptists as a whole adopt the
  Independent or Congregational form of church government, and their
  ecclesiastical assemblies are held for the purpose of mutual stimulus and
  intercourse, and not for the general government of the body, or for
  interference with individual churches. The Particular Baptists of England
  (so called from believing that Christ died only for the elect), the
  Baptists of Scotland and Ireland, the Associated Baptists of America, and
  some of the Seventh-day Baptists, are Calvinistic. The other classes,
  such as the General Baptists (who believe that Christ died for all), are
  Arminian, or at least not Calvinistic. Most Baptists profess to be
  Trinitarians. The Free-will Baptists, the Christian Society, and most of
  the General Baptists of England admit of open communion; the other bodies
  decline communion with any Christians but Baptists. The Associated or
  Calvinistic Baptists long ranked in the United States as the most
  numerous denomination of Christians. The Seventh-day Baptists, or
  Sabbatarians, observe the seventh day of the week. The Free-will Baptists
  profess the doctrine of free salvation. The Anabaptists of the
  Reformation period are not to be confounded with the Baptists, by whom
  their principles were expressly disclaimed. The first regular Baptist
  Church appears to have been formed in the reign of Elizabeth, but we may
  date their first public acknowledgment as distinct from the Anabaptists
  from their petition to Parliament in 1620. The year 1633 provides the
  earliest record of the formation of a Particular Baptist Church in
  London. In 1689 a Baptist General Assembly, held in London, formulated a
  confession of thirty-two articles and a catechism. The Baptist Union,
  formed in 1832, comprehends the greater number of members of the sect in
  Great Britain and Ireland. In July, 1905, a world-congress of Baptists
  was held in London, and the Baptist World Alliance was constituted. The
  total number of members of Baptist Churches in the United Kingdom was
  405,104 in 1922, and 408,029 in 1920. There are nine colleges for
  training ministers, of which the chief are: Bristol Baptist College;
  Regent's Park; Rawdon, Bradford; and the Metropolitan Pastors' College.
  The Regular Baptists in the United States numbered 7,504,447 members in
  1922, and nearly 6,000,000 in 1920, in addition to which there are
  Anti-mission Baptists, Free-will Baptists, and Seventh-day Baptists. In
  Canada there are in all about 128,730 Baptists.&mdash;<span

  miles, about 74,000 being under cultivation. It is divided into eleven
  Church of England parishes; capital, Bridgetown. It is one of the most
  densely-populated areas in the world, the population in 1917 being
  estimated at 186,656, or nearly 1100 to the square mile. The climate is
  very hot, though moderated by the constant trade-winds; and the island is
  subject to dreadful hurricanes. The surface is broken, now without
  forests, and with few streams; the highest point is 1145 feet above the
  sea-level. There are few indigenous mammals or birds. The black lowland
  soil gives great returns of sugar in favourable seasons. The chief
  exports, besides sugar, are molasses and rum; imports: rice, salt meat,
  corn, butter, flour, &amp;c. Both exports and imports were over
  £2,000,000 in 1918. Barbadoes has a considerable transit trade, being in
  some measure the central mart for all the Windward Islands. It is the see
  of a bishop and the head-quarters of the British forces in the West
  Indies. There is a railway across the island, also tramways, telephones,
  &amp;c. The island forms a distinct government under a Governor, an
  Executive and a Legislative Council of 9 members, and a House of Assembly
  of 24 members. Liberal provision is made for education both by old

  and afterwards by the Romans, to everyone who spoke an unintelligible
  language; and hence coming to connote the idea of <i>rude</i>,
  <i>illiterate</i>, <i>uncivilized</i>. This word, therefore, did not
  always convey the idea of something odious or savage; thus a Greek
  character in <!-- Page 392 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page392"></a>[392]</span>Plautus calls Nævius a barbarous poet,
  because he had not written in Greek; and Cicero terms illiterate persons
  without taste 'barbarians'.</p>

  <p><b>Barbarossa</b> ('red-beard'), the name of two famous Turkish
  corsairs of the sixteenth century, who ravaged the shores of the
  Mediterranean, and established themselves in Algiers. The elder of the
  brothers, Aruch or Horuk, was killed in 1518; the younger and more
  notorious, Hayraddin, who captured Tunis, died in 1546. See <i>Frederick
  Barbarossa</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Bar´bary</b>, a general name for the most northerly portion of
  Africa, extending about 2600 miles from Egypt to the Atlantic, with a
  breadth varying from about 140 to 550 miles, comprising Morocco, Algeria,
  Tunisia, and Libya (Tripolitania, Barqa, and Fezzan). The principal races
  are: the Berbers, the original inhabitants, from whom the country takes
  its name; the Arabs, who conquered an extensive portion of it during the
  times of the caliphs; the Bedouins, Jews, Turks, and the French colonists
  of Algeria, &amp;c. The country, which was prosperous under the
  Carthaginians, was, next to Egypt, the richest of the Roman provinces,
  and the Italian States enriched themselves by their intercourse with it.
  In the fifteenth century, however, it became infested with adventurers
  who made the name of Barbary corsair a terror to commerce, a condition of
  things finally removed by the French occupation of Algeria.</p>

  <p><b>Barbary Ape</b> (<i>In&#x16D;us ecaud&#x101;tus</i>), a species of
  ape, or tailless monkey, with greenish-brown hair, of the size of a large
  cat, remarkable for docility, also called the <i>magot</i>. It is common
  in Barbary and other parts of Africa, and some used to live formerly on
  Gibraltar Rock, being the only European monkey, though probably not
  indigenous. It has been the 'showman's ape' from time immemorial.</p>

  <p><b>Bar´bastel</b>, or <b>Barbastelle</b>, a bat with hairy lips
  (<i>Barbastellus comm&#x16B;nis</i>), a native of England.</p>

  <p><b>Barbas´tro</b>, a city, Spain, Arragon, province of Huesca, with an
  interesting cathedral, and some trade and manufactures. Pop. 7202.</p>

  <p><b>Bar´bauld</b>, Anna Letitia, English poet and general writer, was
  born in Leicestershire, 1743, daughter of a Presbyterian minister named
  Aikin. She published a small volume of miscellaneous poems in 1772, and
  in 1773, in conjunction with her brother, Dr. John Aikin, a collection of
  pieces in prose. In 1774 she married the Rev. Rochemont Barbauld. Her
  <i>Early Lessons and Hymns for Children</i>, and various essays and
  poems, won considerable popularity. She edited a collection of English
  novels, with critical and biographical notices; a selection from the
  British essayists of the reign of Anne, and another from Richardson's
  correspondence. Her last long poem, <i>Eighteen Hundred and Eleven</i>,
  appeared in 1812. She died at Stoke-Newington, 1825.</p>

  <p><b>Bar´becue</b>, a word of West Indian origin, meaning a hog, or
  other large animal, roasted whole. In the United States the word means a
  large gathering of people in the open air, for a social or political
  feast, where whole animals are roasted and eaten.</p>

  <p><b>Barbed Wire</b>, wire-rope for fencing or other purposes, having
  fixed in it short bent pieces of wire with sharp projecting points, which
  serve to keep animals from pressing against it. There is an Act of
  Parliament (1893) to prevent the use of barbed-wire fences that form a
  nuisance on a public road or path; and a person employing barbed wire for
  fencing may render himself liable for damages caused by it to another
  person who is legitimately using the adjoining ground. Barbed wire plays
  an important part in the construction of obstacles in modern warfare.
  During the European War, all systems of trenches were protected by thick
  belts of wire. This wire was laid out in various different ways, two of
  the best being known as the Concertina Fence and the Double-apron
  Fence.</p>

  <p><b>Barbel</b> (Barbus), a genus of freshwater fishes of the carp
  family, distinguished by the four fleshy filaments growing from the lips,
  two at the nose and one at each corner of the mouth, forming the kind of
  beard to which the genus owes its name. Of the several species the
  European <i>Barbus vulg&#x101;ris</i>, common in most rivers, has an
  average length of from 12 to 18 inches, and in form and habits strongly
  resembles the pike. Its body is elongated and rounded, olive-coloured
  above and bluish on the sides, and covered with small scales. The upper
  jaw, which is much longer than the lower, forms a snout, with which it
  bores into the mud for worms, insects, aquatic plants, &amp;c. It is
  common in the Thames, where it gives good sport to the angler; but its
  flesh is very coarse, and at the time of spawning the roe is dangerous to
  eat.</p>

  <p><b>Barber</b>, one whose occupation is to shave or trim the beard, or
  to cut and dress hair. The practice of surgery was formerly a part of the
  craft, and by an Act of Henry VIII the Company of Barbers was
  incorporated with the Company of Surgeons&mdash;the company being then
  known as the Barber-surgeons&mdash;with the limitation, however, that the
  surgeons were not to shave or practise 'barbery', and the barbers were to
  perform no higher surgical operation than blood-letting and
  tooth-drawing. This continued till the time of George II. The signs of
  the old profession&mdash;the pole which the patient grasped, its spiral
  decoration in imitation of the bandage, and the basin to catch the
  blood&mdash;are <!-- Page 393 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page393"></a>[393]</span>still sometimes retained. The barbers'
  shops, always notorious for gossip, were in some measure the news centres
  of classic and mediæval times. The ancient hall in London, formerly used
  by the Barber-surgeons, is still standing in Markwell Street,
  Cripplegate.</p>

  <p><b>Barberini</b> (ba<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>r-be-r&#x113;´n&#x113;), a celebrated
  Florentine family, which, since the pontificate of Maffeo Barberini
  (Urban VIII, 1623-44), has occupied a distinguished place among the
  nobility of Rome. During his reign Urban was chiefly intent on the
  aggrandizement of his three nephews, of whom two were appointed
  cardinals, and the third Prince of Palestrina.</p>

    Barberry <i>(Berb&#x115;ris aristata)</i>
  </div>

  <p><b>Bar´berry</b>, a genus of shrubs, nat. ord. Berberidaceæ. The
  common barberry (<i>Berb&#x115;ris vulg&#x101;ris</i>) has serrate,
  pointed leaves (the primary ones reduced to tripartite spines), hanging
  clusters of yellow flowers, and small, orange-red berries, which are
  sometimes made into preserves. The inner bark and roots yield a fine
  yellow dye (berberine). The shrub is a native of temperate Asia, but is
  now generally diffused through Europe and N. America. In Britain it has
  been almost universally banished from hedgerows, owing to its connection
  with the black rust of wheat. Numerous other species inhabit Asia and
  America; those of the section Mahonia have pinnate leaves. <i>B.
  aristata</i> is an erect bush, with furrowed red-brown branches, and
  pendulous clusters of yellow flowers; it thrives best in the south. See
  <i>Irritability</i> and <i>Rust</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Bar´berton</b>, the chief mining-centre of De Kaap gold-fields,

  Bay. British prisoners were confined here in the Boer War (1899-1902).
  Pop. about 2000 (whites).</p>

  <p><b>Bar´bets</b> (Bucconidæ), a family of climbing birds with a thick
  conical beak, having tufts of bristles at its base. Their wings are short
  and their flight somewhat heavy. They have been divided into three
  sub-genera: The <i>barbicans</i> (Pogonias), inhabiting India and Africa,
  and feeding chiefly on fruit; the <i>barbets</i> proper (Bucco), found in
  Africa and America, and nearly related to the woodpeckers; and the
  <i>puff-birds</i> (Tamatia), inhabiting America, and feeding on
  insects.</p>

  <p><b>Barbette</b> (ba<span class="x1"><span

  breastwork of a fortification, from which the artillery may be fired over
  the parapet instead of through an embrasure. In ships of war the name is
  given to a strong breastwork of armour over which heavy guns are fired.

  foundation of his fame in 1788 by his <i>Atlas</i> to Barthélemy's
  <i>Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis</i>. His maps and plans to the works of
  Thucydides, Xenophon, &amp;c., exhibit much erudition, and materially
  advanced the science of ancient geography. He also prepared many modern
  maps, and published various excellent dissertations. He held many

  <p><b>Barbier</b> (ba<span class="x1"><span

  bibliographer (1765-1825). He was appointed keeper of the library of the
  Conseil d'État in 1798; Napoleon made him his librarian in 1807; and he
  was afterwards librarian to Louis XVIII. His <i>Catalogue de la
  Bibliothèque du Conseil d'État</i> (1801-3), and <i>Dictionnaire des

  <p><b>Bar´bour</b>, John, an ancient Scottish poet, contemporary with
  Chaucer, born about 1316. By 1357 he was Archdeacon of Aberdeen, and in
  the following year was appointed a commissioner to treat for the ransom
  of David II. He appears as Auditor of the Exchequer more than once; he
  travelled through England on several occasions, and was pensioned by
  Robert II. His chief poem, <i>The Bruce</i> (Brus), written about 1375,
  was first published in 1571, and the chief manuscripts of the poem are
  those in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh, dated 1489, and in St. John's
  College, Cambridge. Of another long poem, setting forth the Trojan origin
  of the Scottish kings, no MS. remains, unless a portion of two Troy books
  in the Cambridge and Bodleian libraries may be ascribed to Barbour. He
  has also been credited with having compiled a <i>Book of Legends of
  Saints</i>, existing in a single MS. at Cambridge, and published in
  1881-2 by Horstman in his <i>Legenden Sammlung</i>. He died in 1395. He
  was the father of Scottish poetry and history, and his <i>Bruce</i> is
  linguistically of high value. Though wanting in the higher qualities of
  poetry, it is truthful and natural, and often exhibits a high moral
  dignity.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: Andrew Lang,

  pepper, and tobacco are the principal produce, but the island is only
  partially cleared for cultivation. There is no harbour, but a
  well-sheltered roadstead on the west side. It is a dependency of

  <p><b>Barbusse</b>, Henri, a French author born at Asnières in 1874. He
  served in the French army during the European War, and his descriptions

  <p><b>Bar´ca</b>, a division of N. Africa, between the Gulf of Sidra and
  Egypt, annexed by Italy in 1911-2; capital, Bengazi. It formed a portion
  of the ancient Cyrenaica, and from the time of the Ptolemies was known as
  Pentapolis from its five Greek cities. It became part of Tripoli, and
  later a separate province under Turkish dominion. On 18th Oct., 1912, it
  was formally recognized as a dependency of Italy, and forms with Tripoli
  the Italian colony of Libya. The country consists of a rocky plateau. A
  large portion of it is desert, but some parts, especially near the coast,
  are fertile, and yield abundant crops and excellent pasture, the chief
  being wheat, barley, dates, figs, and olives. Flowering shrubs, roses,
  honeysuckles, &amp;c., occur in great variety. There are hardly any
  permanent streams, but the eastern portion is tolerably well watered by
  rains and springs. The exports are grain and cattle, with ostrich
  feathers and ivory from the interior. Next to Bengazi (pop. 35,000), the
  seaport of Derna is the chief town (pop. 8000). The population probably
  does not exceed 300,000. See <i>Cyrenaica</i> and <i>Tripoli</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Barcarolle</b> (-rol´), a species of song sung by the

  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>r-thel-&#x14D;´na<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>), next to Madrid the chief city of
  Spain, capital of the province of Barcelona, and formerly capital of the
  kingdom of Catalonia; finely situated on the northern portion of the
  Spanish Mediterranean coast. It is divided into the upper and lower town;
  the former modern, regular, stone-built, and often of an English
  architectural type, the latter old, irregular, brick-built, and with
  traces of Eastern influence in the architecture. The harbour is suited to
  accommodate large vessels. The principal manufactures are cottons, silks,
  woollens, machinery, paper, glass, chemicals, stoneware, soap; exports
  manufactured goods, wine and brandy, fruit, oil, &amp;c.; imports coals,
  textile fabrics, machinery, cotton, fish, hides, silks, timber, &amp;c.
  The city contains a university, several public libraries, a museum, a
  large arsenal, cannon-foundry, &amp;c. Barcelona was, until the twelfth
  century, governed by its own counts, but was afterwards united with
  Arragon. In 1640, with the rest of Catalonia, it placed itself under the
  French Crown; in 1652 it submitted again to the Spanish Government; in
  1697 it was taken by the French, but was restored to Spain at the Peace
  of Ryswick. It has had several severe visitations of cholera and yellow
  fever, and has been the scene of many serious and sanguinary revolts, as
  in 1836, 1840, and 1909. Pop. 618,766.&mdash;The province has an area of
  2968 sq. miles; pop. 1,191,386 (1918). It is generally mountainous, but
  well cultivated, and among the most thickly peopled in Spain. <!-- Page

  <p><b>Bar´clay</b>, Alexander, a poet of the sixteenth century, most
  probably a native of Scotland, born about 1475; for some years a priest
  and chaplain of St. Mary Ottery, in Devonshire; afterwards a Benedictine
  monk of Ely; subsequently a Franciscan, and also the holder of one or two
  livings; died 1552. His principal work was a satire, entitled <i>The Shyp
  of Folys of this Worlde</i>, part translation and part imitation of
  Brandt's <i>Narrenschiff</i> (Ship of Fools), and printed by Pynson in
  1509. He also wrote <i>The Myrrour of Good Maners</i>, and some
  <i>Egloges</i> (Eclogues), both printed by Pynson, as well as
  translations, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Barclay</b>, John, poet and satirist, son of a Scottish father,
  born at Pont-à-Mousson (Lorraine) in 1582, and probably educated in the
  Jesuits' College there. Having settled in England, he published a Latin
  politico-satirical romance, entitled <i>Euphormionis Satyricon</i>,
  having as its object the exposure of the Jesuits. In 1616 he left England
  for Rome, received a pension from Pope Paul V, and died in 1621. His
  chief work is a singular romance in Latin, entitled <i>Argenis</i>
  (Paris, 1621), thought by some to be an allegory bearing on the political
  state of Europe at the period. Several seventeenth-century romances were
  indebted to this work, among others Fénelon's <i>Télémaque</i> and
  Calderon's <i>Argenis y Poliarco</i>. It has been translated into several
  modern languages. His shorter poems appeared in the <i>Delitiæ Poetarum
  Scotorum</i>,</p>

  <p><b>Barclay</b>, Robert, the celebrated apologist of the Quakers, born
  in 1648 at Gordonstown, Moray, and educated at Paris, where he became a
  Roman Catholic. He was recalled home by his father, whose example he
  followed in becoming a Quaker. His first treatise in support of his
  adopted principles, published at Aberdeen in the year 1670, under the
  title of <i>Truth Cleared of Calumnies</i>, together with his subsequent
  writings, did much to rectify public sentiment in regard to the Quakers.
  His chief work, in Latin, <i>An Apology for the True Christian
  Divinity</i>, was soon reprinted at Amsterdam, and quickly translated
  into German, Dutch, French, and Spanish, and, by the author himself, into
  English. His fame was now widely diffused; and, in his travels with
  William Penn and George Fox through England, Holland, and Germany, to
  spread the opinions of the Quakers, he was received everywhere with the
  highest respect. The last of his productions, <i>On the Possibility and
  Necessity of an Inward and Immediate Revelation</i>, was not published in
  England until 1686; from which time Barclay lived quietly with his
  family. He died, after a short illness, at his own house of Ury,
  Kincardineshire, in 1690. He was a friend of and had influence with James
  II.</p>

  <p><b>Barclay</b>, Sir Thomas, British barrister, born in 1853. Educated
  at the Universities of London, Paris, Bonn, and Jena, he was sent to
  Paris in 1876 as correspondent of <i>The Times</i>. He has been greatly
  instrumental in bringing about a better understanding between England and
  France. He was knighted in 1904, and entered Parliament in 1910. His
  works include: <i>Problems of International Practice and Diplomacy</i>;
  <i>The Turco-Italian War and its Problems</i>; <i>Law and Usage of
  War</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Barclay de Tolly</b>, Michael, Prince, a distinguished general and
  field-marshal of Russia, born in 1755. His family, of Scottish origin,
  had been established in Livonia since 1689. He entered the army at an
  early age, served in various campaigns against the Turks, Swedes, and
  Poles, and in 1811 was named Minister of War. On the invasion of Napoleon
  he was transferred to the chief command of the army, and adopted a plan
  of retreat; his forces did not greatly exceed 100,000 men, but the Court
  became impatient, and after the capture of Smolensk by the French he was
  superseded by Kutusov. Sinking all personal feeling, he asked leave to
  serve under his successor, commanded the right wing at the battle of the
  Moskwa, maintained his position, and covered the retreat of the rest of
  the army. After the battle of Bautzen, in 1813, he was reappointed to the
  chief command, which he had soon after to resign to Prince Schwarzenberg.
  He forced the surrender of General Vandamme after the battle of Dresden,
  took part in the decisive battle of Leipzig, and was made a field-marshal
  in Paris. In 1815 he received from the emperor the title of prince, and
  from Louis XVIII the badge of the Order of Military Merit. He died in
  1818.</p>

  <p><b>Bard</b>, one of an order among the ancient Celtic tribes, whose
  occupation was to compose and sing verses in honour of the heroic
  achievements of princes and brave men, generally to the accompaniment of
  the harp. Their verses also <!-- Page 396 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page396"></a>[396]</span>frequently embodied religious or ethical
  precepts, genealogies, laws, &amp;c. Their existence and function was
  known to the Romans two centuries <span class="scac">B.C.</span>; but of
  the Gallic bards only the tradition of their popularity survives. The
  first Welsh bards of whom anything is extant are Taliesin, Aneurin, and
  Llywarch, of the sixth century. A considerable lacuna then occurs in
  their history until the order was reconstituted in the tenth century by
  King Howel Dha, and again in the eleventh by Gryffith ap Conan. Edward I
  is said to have hanged all the Welsh bards as promoters of sedition. Some
  modern attempts have been made in Wales to revive bardism, and the
  Cambrian Society was formed in 1818, for this purpose and for the
  preservation of the remains of the ancient literature. The revived
  Eisteddfodau, or bardic festivals, have been so far exceedingly popular.
  In Ireland there were three classes of bards: those who sang of war,
  religion, &amp;c., those who chanted the laws, and those who gave
  genealogies and family histories in verse. They were famous harpists. In
  the Highlands of Scotland there are considerable remains of compositions
  supposed to be those of their old bards still preserved.&mdash;<span

  the statement that from the union of God with matter sprang Christ and a
  female Holy Ghost, from whom in turn sprang various existences. He
  propagated his doctrines in Syrian hymns (<i>Hymn on the Soul</i>), the
  first in the language. His son, Harmonius, was also an able hymn-writer.

  <p><b>Baril´la</b>, is the commercial name for impure sodium carbonate
  imported from Spain and the Levant. At one time all sodium carbonate
  required for industrial purposes was prepared from barilla obtained by
  burning various marine plants (Salsola, Salicornia, and others). Only 25
  per cent of the weight of the ash contained soda, and consequently its
  import was expensive and considerably added to the price of the
  manufacture of glass and soap. During the Napoleonic wars the price of
  barilla rose to such a height that Napoleon offered a reward for the
  discovery of a process for the manufacture of sodium carbonate. A
  chemist, Leblanc, in 1791 invented a new process by which sodium
  carbonate could be obtained from common salt, and this entirely
  superseded barilla. Plants are still grown in Southern France and Spain
  to obtain soda and other substances from the ash; but almost all the
  sodium carbonate of the present day is manufactured chemically.</p>

  <p><b>Baring</b>, the name of a famous English family of bankers and

  house of Baring Brothers &amp; Co., and of which members now hold four
  peerages, namely, two earldoms&mdash;Northbrook and Cromer&mdash;and two
  baronies&mdash;Ashburton and Revelstoke. The founder of the house was
  Francis Baring (1740-1810), whose father was a cloth manufacturer near
  Exeter, and grandfather pastor of the Lutheran Church at Bremen, the
  family being thus of German origin. Francis Baring settled in London,
  attained a high position in the mercantile and financial world, was long
  a member of Parliament and a director of the East India Company, and was
  made a baronet in 1793. Of his sons, one, Alexander, was created Baron
  Ashburton (in 1835), and rendered important political services in
  connection with the boundary treaty concluded between Britain and the
  United States, and known by his title (see <i>Ashburton</i>, <i>Ashburton
  Treaty</i>). His son, the second Lord Ashburton (1799-1864), held a
  position of some note in politics, and his first wife, a daughter of the
  sixth Earl of Sandwich, was fond of the society of both politicians and
  literary men, among those who were on friendly terms with her being <!--

  Baring's eldest son, Thomas, was father of Francis Thornhill Baring,
  first Lord Northbrook (1796-1866), whose eldest son, Thomas, was created
  Earl of Northbrook in 1876, and held successively a number of high
  positions, among them that of Viceroy of India (1872-6) and First Lord of
  the Admiralty (1880-5). (See <i>Northbrook</i>.) Another son of Sir
  Francis, Henry Baring, was father of Edward Baring, the first Baron
  Revelstoke (born in 1828, died in 1897), who was long one of the most
  conspicuous members of the financial world of London, and was raised to
  the peerage as baron in 1885. He had full management of the great house
  of Baring Brothers, which under him was long most prosperous, but in 1890
  fell into temporary difficulties. Henry Baring was father also of Evelyn
  Baring, Earl Cromer (q.v.).</p>

  <p><b>Bark</b>, properly the <i>periderm</i>, or outer covering, of woody
  stems and roots, composed of dead tissues cut off from the living parts
  of the organ by one or more layers of impervious cork. It serves to
  prevent loss of water, and also affords protection against animals and
  fungi. The outermost bark is continually sloughed in the form of scales
  (Scots Pine) or sheets (Common Birch), being regenerated from within by
  the activity of the cork-cambium (<i>phellogen</i>). Bark is usually rich
  in waste-products, many of which are of economic value, such as tannin,
  gums, &amp;c. Bottle-cork is the bark of the cork-oak. Bark for tanning
  is obtained from oak, hemlock-spruce, species of acacia, &amp;c. Peruvian
  and Angostura barks, cinnamon, &amp;c., are other useful barks. As
  commonly used, bark denotes all the tissues external to the
  <i>cambium</i>.</p>

  principal plays are: <i>The Voysey Inheritance</i> (1905), <i>Waste</i>
  (1907), <i>The Madras House</i> (1910). He has published a book (in which
  William Archer collaborated) called <i>A National Theatre</i>, and
  another entitled <i>The Red Cross in France</i>. His revivals of
  Shakespeare have introduced some new ideas of mounting and
  stage-effects.</p>

  <p><b>Barker's Mill</b>, also called Scottish turbine, a hydraulic
  machine on the principle of what is known as the hydraulic tourniquet.
  This consists of an upright vessel free to rotate about a vertical axis,
  and having at its lower end two discharging pipes projecting horizontally
  on either side and bent in opposite directions at the ends, through which
  the water is discharged horizontally, the direction of discharge being
  mainly at right angles to a line joining the discharging <!-- Page 399
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page399"></a>[399]</span>orifice to the
  axis. The backward pressures at the bends of the tubes, arising from the
  two issuing jets of water, cause the apparatus to revolve in an opposite
  direction to the issuing fluid. The machine was invented by a Dr. Barker
  towards the end of the seventeenth century.</p>

  <p><b>Bar´ley</b>, the name of several cereal plants of the genus
  Hordeum, ord. Gramineæ: (grasses), yielding a grain used as food and also
  for making malt, from which are prepared beer, porter, and whisky. Barley
  has been known and cultivated from remote antiquity, and beer was made
  from it among the Egyptians. It is mentioned in <i>Exodus</i>, in
  connection with the ten plagues; and it is referred to in ancient Chinese
  records. Excellent barley is produced in Britain. The species principally
  cultivated are <i>Hord&#x115;um dist&#x12D;chum</i>, two-rowed barley;
  <i>H. vulg&#x101;re</i>, four-rowed barley; and <i>H. hexastichum</i>,
  six-rowed, of which the small variety is the sacred barley of the
  ancients. The varieties of the four- and six-rowed species are generally
  coarser than those of the two-rowed, and adapted for a poorer soil and
  more exposed situation. Some of these are called <i>bere</i> or
  <i>bigg</i>. In Britain barley occupies more than 22½ per cent of the
  land under corn, but in N. America the extent of it as a crop is
  comparatively small, being in Canada, however, relatively greater than in
  the States, and the Canadian barley is of very high quality. Barley is
  better adapted for cold climates than any other grain, and some of the
  coarser varieties are cultivated where no other cereal can be grown.
  Russia devotes a surface of over 20,000,000 acres to barley, i.e. a
  little under 11 per cent of the cereal area of the country. Germany has
  4,000,000 and France 1,800,000 acres of barley. Some species of the
  genus, three of which are natives of Britain, are mere grasses.
  <i>Pot</i> or <i>Scotch barley</i> is the grain deprived of the husk in a
  mill. <i>Pearl barley</i> is the grain polished and rounded and deprived
  of husk and pellicle. <i>Patent barley</i> is the farina obtained by
  grinding pearl barley. <i>Barley-water</i>, a decoction of pearl barley,
  is used in medicine as possessing emollient, diluent, and expectorant
  qualities.</p>

  fortune. On his return to America he was appointed Minister
  Plenipotentiary to France (1811), but died near Cracow in 1812 on his way
  to meet Napoleon. His principal poem, <i>The Columbiad</i> (<i>The Vision
  of Columbus</i>), dealing with American history from the time of

  <p><b>Bar´nacle</b>, the name of a family (Lepadidæ) of marine
  crustaceous animals, ord. Cirripedia. They are enveloped by a mantle and
  shell, composed of five principal valves and several smaller pieces,
  joined together by a membrane attached to their circumference; and they
  are furnished with a long, flexible, fleshy stalk or peduncle, provided
  with muscles, by which they attach themselves to ships' bottoms,
  submerged timber, &amp;c. They feed on small marine animals, brought
  within their reach by the water and secured by their tentacula. Some of
  the larger species are edible. According to an old fable, these animals
  produced barnacle geese.</p>

  <p><b>Barnacle Goose</b> (<i>Anser Bernicla</i> or <i>leucopsis</i>), a
  summer visitant of the northern seas, in size rather smaller than the
  common wild goose, and having the forehead and cheeks white, the upper
  body and neck black. A fable asserts that the crustaceans called
  barnacles changed into geese, and various theories have been framed to
  account for its origin. Max Müller supposes the geese were originally
  called <i>Hiberniculæ</i> or Irish geese, and that barnacle is a
  corruption of this; but the resemblance of a barnacle to a goose hanging
  by the head may account for it. The Brent Goose is also sometimes called
  the Barnacle Goose, but the two should not be confused.</p>

  <p><b>Barnard-Castle</b>, a town, England, County Durham, giving name to

  <p><b>Barnar´do</b>, Thomas John, philanthropist, born in Ireland in
  1845, qualified as a medical practitioner, studying in London, Edinburgh,
  and Paris, established his first home for neglected London children in
  1867, and for the rest of his life was engaged in the same class of work.
  Up to his death in 1905 he had nearly 60,000 destitute waifs cared for
  and trained in the institutions with which his name is connected, many of
  the children having been sent to Canada or other colonies. The Barnardo
  homes and institutions have become very numerous, being established in
  various English counties as well as in London, a few being in Canada. A
  naval training-school for boys is included among them. It was a rule of
  the founder that no destitute child should be refused admission. The
  homes have since 1899 been under a council or body <!-- Page 401 --><span

  <p><b>Barneveldt</b> (bär'ne-velt), Johan van Olden, grand pensionary of
  Holland during the struggle with Philip II of Spain, born in 1547. After
  the assassination of William of Orange, and the conquest of the south
  provinces by the Spaniards under Parma, he headed the embassy to secure
  English aid. Finding, however, that the Earl of Leicester proved a worse
  than useless ally, he secured the elevation of the young Maurice of
  Nassau to the post of Stadtholder, at the same time by his own wise
  administration doing much to restore the prosperity of the State. After
  serving as ambassador to France and England, he succeeded in 1607 in
  obtaining from Spain a recognition of the independence of the States, and
  two years later in concluding with her the twelve years' truce. Maurice,
  ambitious of absolute rule and jealous of the influence of Barneveldt,
  was interested in the continuance of the war, and lost no opportunity of
  hostile action against the great statesman. In this he was aided by the
  strongly-marked theologic division in the State between the Gomarites
  (the Calvinistic and popular party) and the Arminians, of whom Barneveldt
  was a supporter. Maurice, who had thrown in his lot with the Gomarites,
  encouraged the idea that the Arminians were the friends of Spain, and
  procured the assembly of a synod at Dort (1618), which violently
  condemned them. Barneveldt and his friends Grotius and Hoogerbeets were
  arrested, and subjected to a so-called trial; and Barneveldt, to whom the
  country owed its political existence and the Commons their retention of
  legislative power, was beheaded on 13th May, 1619. His sons, four years
  later, attempted to avenge his death; one was beheaded, the other escaped
  to Spain. <!-- Page 402 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><b>Barograph</b>, a kind of aneroid barometer, which, by means of
  special mechanism and appliances, is made to furnish automatically a
  continuous record of the successive changes in atmospheric pressure. The
  paper that receives the record is made to move by clockwork while in
  contact with the index pencil, which rises and falls according to
  alterations of atmospheric pressure.</p>

  <p><b>Barom´eter</b>, an instrument for measuring the weight or pressure
  of the atmosphere and thus determining changes in the weather, the height
  of mountains, and other phenomena. It had its origin about the middle of
  the seventeenth century in an experiment of Torricelli, an Italian, who
  found that if a glass tube about 3 feet in length, open at one end only,
  and filled with mercury, were placed vertically with the open end in a
  cup of the same fluid metal, a portion of the mercury descended into the
  cup, leaving a column only about 30 inches in height in the tube. He
  inferred, therefore, that the atmospheric pressure on the surface of the
  mercury in the cup forced it up the tube to the height of 30 inches, and
  that this was so because the weight of a column of air from the cup to
  the top of the atmosphere was only equal to that of a column of mercury
  of the same base and 30 inches high. Pascal confirmed the conclusion in
  1645; six years afterwards it was found by Perrier that the height of the
  mercury in the Torricellian tube varied with the weather; and in 1655
  Boyle proposed to use the instrument to measure the height of
  mountains.</p>

    Common Upright Barometer; Marine Barometer
  </div>

  <p>The common or <i>cistern</i> barometer, which is a modification of the
  Torricellian tube, consists of a glass tube 33 inches in length and about
  one-third of an inch in diameter, hermetically sealed at the top, and
  having the lower end resting in a small vessel containing mercury, or
  bent upwards and terminating in a glass bulb partly occupied by the
  mercury and open to the atmosphere. The tube is first filled with
  purified mercury, and then inverted, and there is affixed to it a scale
  to mark the height of the mercurial column, which comparatively seldom
  rises above 31 inches or sinks below 28 inches. In general the rising of
  the mercury presages fair weather, and its falling the contrary, a great
  and sudden fall being the usual presage of a <!-- Page 403 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page403"></a>[403]</span>storm. The
  weather-points on the ordinary barometric scale are as follows: At 28
  inches, stormy weather; 28½, much rain or snow; 29, rain or snow; 29½,
  changeable; 30, fair or frost; 30½, settled fair or frost; 31, very dry
  weather or hard frost. Certain attendant signs, however, have also to be
  noted: thus, when fair or foul weather follows almost immediately upon
  the rise or fall of the mercury, the change is usually of short duration;
  while if the change of weather be delayed for some days after the
  variation in the mercury, it is usually of long continuance. The
  direction of the wind has also to be taken into account.</p>

    Siphon Barometer; Wheel Barometer
  </div>

  <p>The <i>siphon</i> barometer consists of a bent tube, generally of
  uniform bore, having two unequal legs, the longer closed, the shorter
  open. A sufficient quantity of mercury having been introduced to fill the
  longer leg, the instrument is set upright, and the mercury takes such a
  position that the difference of the levels in the two legs represents the
  pressure of the atmosphere. In the best siphon barometers there are two
  scales, one for each leg, the divisions on one being reckoned upwards,
  and on the other downwards from an intermediate zero point, so that the
  sum of the two readings is the difference of levels of the mercury in the
  two branches.</p>

  <p>The <i>wheel</i> barometer is the one that is most commonly used for
  domestic purposes. It is far from being accurate, but it is often
  preferred for ordinary use on account of the greater range of its scale,
  by which small differences in the height of the column of mercury are
  more easily observed. It usually consists of a siphon barometer having a
  float resting on the surface of the mercury in the open branch, a thread
  attached to the float passing over a pulley, and having a weight as a
  counterpoise to the float at its extremity. As the mercury rises and
  falls the thread and weight turn the pulley, which again moves the index
  of the dial.</p>

  <p>The <i>mountain</i> barometer is a portable mercurial barometer with a
  tripod support and a long scale for measuring the altitude of mountains.
  To prevent breakage, through the oscillations of such a heavy liquid as
  mercury, it is usually carried inverted, or it is furnished with a
  movable basin and a screw, by means of which the mercury may be forced up
  to the top of the tube. For delicate operations, such as the measurement
  of altitudes, the scale of the barometer is furnished with a nonius or
  vernier, which greatly increases the minuteness and accuracy of the
  scale. For the rough estimate of altitudes the following rule is
  sufficient: As the sum of the heights of the mercury at the bottom and
  top of the mountain is to their difference, so is 52,000 to the height to
  be measured, in feet. (See also <i>Heights, Measurement of</i>.) In exact
  barometric observations two corrections require to be made, one for the
  depression of the mercury in the tube by capillary attraction, the other
  for temperature, which increases or diminishes the bulk of the mercury.
  In regard to the measurement of heights, the general rule is to subtract
  the ten-thousandth part of the observed altitude for every degree of
  Fahrenheit above 32°.</p>

    Aneroid Barometer
  </div>

  <p>In the <i>aneroid</i> barometer, as its name implies (Gr. <i>a</i>,
  not, <i>n&#x113;ros</i>, liquid), no fluid is employed, the action being
  dependent upon the susceptibility to atmospheric pressure shown by a flat
  circular metallic chamber from which the air has been partially
  exhausted, and which has a flexible top and bottom of corrugated metal
  plate. By an ingenious arrangement of springs and levers the depression
  or elevation of the surface of the box is registered by an index on the
  dial, by which means it is also greatly magnified, being given in inches
  to correspond with <!-- Page 404 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page404"></a>[404]</span>the mercurial barometer. Aneroids are,
  however, generally less reliable than mercurial barometers, with which
  they should be frequently compared. The illustration shows an aneroid
  without its case. At the centre of the partially exhausted metal chamber
  is a small pillar [<span class="scac">M</span>], connected with a steel
  spring [<span class="scac">R</span>]. The rise and fall of the top of the
  chamber, due to changing atmospheric pressure, is transmitted by means of
  the levers [<span class="scac">L</span>], and [<i>m</i>] to a metallic
  axis [<i>r</i>], and this axis carries a lever [<i>t</i>], whose end is
  attached to a chain [<i>s</i>], which turns a drum on whose axis the
  index needle is fixed.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: C.

  <p><b>Bar´on</b>, originally, in the feudal system, the vassal or
  immediate tenant of any superior; but the term was afterwards restricted
  to the king's barons, and again to the greater of these only, who
  attended the Great Council, or who, at a later date, were summoned by
  writ to Parliament. It was the second rank of nobility, until dukes and
  marquesses were introduced and placed above the earls, and viscounts also
  set above the barons, who therefore now hold the lowest rank in the
  British peerage. The present barons are of three classes: (1) barons by
  writ, whose ancestors have long sat in the Upper House; (2) by patent;
  (3) by tenure, i.e. holding the title as annexed to land. The coronet is

  nominally to promote the colonization and defence of Ulster, each
  baronet, on his creation, being then obliged to pay into the treasury a
  sum of £1095, exclusive of fees. Baronets of Ireland were instituted in
  1620, and of Scotland in 1625, the latter being called baronets of Nova
  Scotia, because their creation was originally intended to further the
  colonization of Nova Scotia. But the baronets of Scotland and of England
  have been baronets of Great Britain if created since 1707; since 1801 all
  creations have been known as baronetcies of the United Kingdom. A baronet
  has the title of 'Sir' prefixed to his Christian and surname, and his
  wife is 'Lady' so-and-so. Baronets rank before all knights except Knights
  of the Garter, the Thistle, and St. Patrick. They have as their badge a
  'bloody hand' (the arms of Ulster), that is, a left hand, erect and open,
  cut off at the wrist, and red in colour.&mdash;<span

  India and Africa, he joined the revolutionary party and was a deputy in
  the <i>tiers état</i>. He took part in the attack upon the Bastille and
  upon the Tuileries, and voted for the death of Louis XVI. In the
  subsequent events he displeased Robespierre, and on this account joined
  the members of the committee, who foresaw danger awaiting them, and being
  entrusted with the chief command of the forces of his party he made
  himself master of Robespierre. On 4th Feb., 1795, he was elected
  president of the Convention, and on 5th Oct., when the troops of the
  sections which favoured the royal cause approached, Barras for a second
  time received the chief command of the forces of the Convention. On this
  occasion he employed General Bonaparte, for whom he procured the chief

  <p><b>Barrier Reef</b>, a coral reef, or rather series of reefs,
  extending for 1260 miles off the <span class="scac">N.&nbsp;E.</span> coast of
  Australia, at a distance from land ranging from 10 to 100 miles. In
  sailing along this coast, steamers generally take the route inside the
  reef, where there is a channel about 12 fathoms deep throughout,
  protected by the reefs themselves; the outer channel is safer for sailing
  vessels.</p>

  <p><b>Barrier Treaty</b>, the treaty (1718) by which, when the Spanish
  Netherlands were ceded to Austria, the Dutch secured the right to
  garrison several border fortresses of the country at the expense of
  Austria, to serve as a barrier against France. It was declared void in
  1781 by Joseph II.</p>

  <p><b>Bar´rington</b>, Daines, son of Viscount Barrington, lawyer,
  antiquarian, and naturalist, born 1727, died 1800. He wrote many papers

  <p><b>Bar´rister</b>, in England or Ireland, an advocate or pleader, who
  has been admitted by one of the Inns of Court, viz. the Inner Temple,
  Middle Temple, Lincoln's Inn, or Gray's Inn, to plead at the bar. It is
  they who speak before all the higher courts, being instructed in regard
  to the case they have in hand by means of the <i>brief</i> which they
  receive from the solicitor who may happen to engage their services, and
  which has a certain fee endorsed upon it as the sum to be paid for the
  barrister's services in the case. Before a student can be admitted to the
  bar he must have been a member of one of those societies, and have kept
  twelve terms there. The examinations, which had dwindled into mere forms,
  have been revived and made more stringent. Barristers are sometimes
  called <i>utter</i> or <i>outer barristers</i>, to distinguish them from
  the king's counsel, who sit within the bar in the courts and are
  distinguished by a silk gown. Barristers are also spoken of as
  <i>counsel</i>, as in the phrase <i>opinion of counsel</i>, that is, a
  written opinion on a case obtained from a barrister before whom the facts
  have been laid. All judges are selected from the barristers. A barrister
  cannot maintain an action for his fees, which are considered purely
  honorary. A <i>revising barrister</i> is a barrister appointed to revise
  the list of persons in any locality who have a vote for a member of
  Parliament. The term corresponding to barrister is in Scotland
  <i>advocate</i>, in the United States <i>counsellor-at-law</i>; but the
  position of the latter is not quite the same.&mdash;Cf. J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;V.

  <p><b>Bar´ros</b>, João de, Portuguese historian, born 1496. He was
  attached to the Court of King Emmanuel, who, after the publication in
  1520 of Barros' romance, <i>The Emperor Clarimond</i>, urged him to
  undertake a history of the Portuguese in India, which appeared thirty-two
  years later. King John III appointed Barros Governor of the Portuguese
  settlements in Guinea, and General Agent for these colonies, further
  presenting him in 1530 with the province of Maranham, in Brazil, for the
  purpose of colonization. For his losses by the last enterprise the king
  indemnified him, and he died in retirement in 1570. Besides his standard
  work, the <i>Decadas</i>, a history of the Portuguese in India (a
  complete edition of which appeared at Lisbon between 1778 and 1788), he
  wrote a moral dialogue on compromise, and the first <i>Portuguese

  <p><b>Bar´row</b>, Isaac, an eminent English mathematician and divine,
  born in London in 1630; studied at the Charterhouse and at Trinity
  College, Cambridge, of which he became a fellow in 1649. After a course
  of medical studies he turned to divinity, mathematics, and astronomy, and
  took his <span class="scac">M.&nbsp;A.</span> degree in 1652, and, failing to
  obtain the Cambridge Greek professorship, went abroad. In 1659 he was
  ordained; in 1660 elected Greek professor at Cambridge; in 1662 professor
  of geometry in Gresham College; and in 1663 Lucasian professor of
  mathematics at Cambridge, a post which he resigned to Newton in 1669. In
  1670 he was created <span class="scac">D.&nbsp;D.</span>, in 1672 master of
  Trinity College, and in 1675 vice-chancellor of Cambridge University. He
  died in 1677. His principal mathematical works (written in Latin) were:
  <i>Euclidis Elementa</i> (1655); <i>Euclidis Data</i> (1657);
  <i>Mathematicæ Lectiones</i> (1664-6); <i>Lectiones Opticæ</i> (1669);

  <p><b>Barrow</b>, Sir John, Bart., geographer and man of letters, born in
  1764 in Lancashire. At the age of sixteen he went in a whaler to
  Greenland; and later on was teacher of mathematics in a school at
  Greenwich. In 1792 he was sent with Lord Macartney, in his embassy to
  China, to take charge of philosophical instruments for presentation to
  the Chinese emperor. His account of this journey was of great value, and
  not less so was the account of his travels in South Africa, whither he
  went in 1797 as secretary to Macartney. In 1804 he was appointed second
  secretary to the Admiralty, a post occupied by him for forty years. In
  1835 he was made a baronet; and he died in 1848, three years after his
  retirement. Besides the accounts of his own travels, he published lives
  of Earl Macartney, Lord Anson, and Lord Howe; <i>Voyages of Discovery and
  Research within the Arctic Regions</i>; an <i>Autobiography</i> written

  <p><b>Bar´row-in-Fur´ness</b>, a seaport, county and parliamentary
  borough of Lancashire, in the district of Furness, opposite the Island of
  Walney, a town that has increased from a fishing-hamlet with 100
  inhabitants in 1848 to a town of 74,254 inhabitants in 1921. Its
  prosperity is due to the mines of red hematite iron-ore which abound in
  the district, and to the railway rendering its excellent natural harbour
  available. It has several large docks, besides graving-docks, a floating
  dock capable of receiving vessels of 3000 tons, a large timber pond,
  &amp;c. There is an extensive trade in timber, cattle, grain, and flour;
  and iron-ore and pig-iron are largely shipped. It has numerous
  blast-furnaces, and one of the largest Bessemer-steel works in the world.
  Besides ironworks, a large business is done in shipbuilding, the making
  of railway wagons and rolling-stock, ropes, sails, bricks, &amp;c. A town
  hall, erected at a cost of £60,000, was opened in 1887. Barrow-in-Furness

  as <i>long</i>, <i>bowl</i>, <i>bell</i>, <i>cone</i>, and <i>broad</i>
  barrows. The practice of barrow-burial is of unknown antiquity and almost
  universal, barrows being found all over Europe, in Northern Africa, Asia
  Minor, Afghanistan, Western India, and in America. In the earliest
  barrows the enclosed bodies were simply laid upon the ground, with stone
  or bone implements and weapons beside them. In barrows of later date the
  remains are generally enclosed in a stone cist. Frequently cremation
  preceded the erection of the barrow, the ashes being enclosed in an urn
  or cist. A detailed description of an ancient barrow-burial is given in

  appointed captain in the royal navy. In recognition of his further
  services he was made commodore, subsequently receiving letters of
  nobility. Brusque, if not vulgar, in manner, and ridiculed by the Court
  for his indifference to ceremony, he made the navy of the nation
  everywhere respected, and furnished some of the most striking chapters in

  Mediterranean. The first volume of his <i>Wanderungen durch die
  Küstenländer des Mittelmeeres</i> was published in 1849, in which year he
  was invited by the British Government to join Dr. Overweg in accompanying
  Richardson's expedition to Central Africa. The expedition set out from
  Tripoli in Feb., 1850, and, in spite of the death both of Richardson and
  Overweg, Barth did not return to Tripoli till the autumn of 1855. His
  explorations, which extended over an area of about 2,000,000 sq. miles,
  determined the course of the Niger and the true nature of the Sahara. The
  English account of it was entitled <i>Travels and Discoveries in North

  <p><b>Bartholomew, Massacre of St.</b>, the brutal slaughter of the
  French Protestants, which began on 24th Aug., 1572, by secret orders from
  Charles IX, at the instigation of his mother, Catherine de' Medici, and
  in which, according to Sully, 70,000 Huguenots, including women and
  children, were murdered throughout the country. During the minority of
  Charles and the regency of his mother, a long war raged in France between
  the Catholics and Huguenots, the leaders of the latter being the Prince
  of Condé and Admiral Coligny. In 1570 overtures were made by the Court to
  the Huguenots, which resulted in a treaty of peace. This treaty blinded
  the chiefs of the Huguenots, particularly Admiral Coligny, who was tired
  of the civil war. The king appeared to have entirely disengaged himself
  from the influence of the Guises and his mother; he invited Coligny to
  his Court, and honoured him as a father. The most artful means were
  employed to increase this delusion. The sister of the king was married to
  the Prince de Béarn (18th Aug., 1572) in order to allure the most
  distinguished Huguenots to Paris. On 22nd Aug. a shot from a window
  wounded the admiral. The king hastened to visit him, and swore to punish
  the author of the villainy; but on the same day he was induced by his
  mother to believe that the admiral had designs on his life. "God's
  death!" he exclaimed; "kill the admiral; and not only him, but all the
  Huguenots; let none remain to disturb us." The following night Catherine
  held the council, which fixed the execution for the night of St.
  Bartholomew, 24th Aug., 1572. After the assassination of Coligny, a bell
  from the tower of the royal palace at midnight gave to the assembled
  companies of burghers the signal for the general massacre of the
  Huguenots. The Prince of Condé and the King of Navarre saved their lives
  by going to mass and pretending to embrace the Catholic religion. By the
  king's orders the massacre was extended throughout the whole kingdom; and
  the horrible slaughter continued for thirty days in almost all the
  provinces.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: Henry White,

  celebrated Italian sculptor, born at Florence about 1778, died 1850. He
  studied and worked in Paris, and was patronized by Napoleon. On the fall
  of the Empire he returned to Florence, where he continued to exercise his
  profession. Among his greater works may be mentioned his groups of
  <i>Charity</i>, and <i>Hercules and Lichas</i>, a colossal bust of
  Napoleon, and the beautiful monument in the cathedral of Lausanne,
  erected in memory of Lady Stratford Canning. Bartolini ranks next to
  Canova among modern Italian sculptors.</p>

  <p><b>Bartolommeo</b> (-m&#x101;´o), Fra, or <b>Baccio Della Porta</b>
  (ba<span class="x1"><span class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>ch&#x14D;´),
  Italian painter, born at Florence 1475, died there 1517. He studied
  painting in Florence, and acquired a more perfect knowledge of art from
  the works of Leonardo da Vinci. He was an admirer and follower of
  Savonarola, on whose death he took the Dominican habit, and assumed the
  name of Fra Bartolommeo. He was the friend of Michael Angelo and Raphael;
  painted many religious pictures, among them a <i>Saint Mark</i> and a
  <i>Saint Sebastian</i>, which are greatly admired. His colouring, in
  vigour and brilliancy, comes near to that of Titian and Giorgione. His
  <i>Holy Family</i> is in the National Gallery, London.</p>

  <p><b>Bartolozzi</b> (-lot´s&#x113;), Francesco, a distinguished
  engraver, born at Florence in 1725, or, according to others, in 1730,
  died at Lisbon 1815. In Venice, in Florence, and Milan he etched several
  pieces on sacred subjects, and then went to London, where he received
  great encouragement. After forty years' residence in London, he went to
  Lisbon on the invitation of the Prince Regent of Portugal. He became
  director of the National Academy at Lisbon, where he remained till his
  death.</p>

  <p><b>Bar´ton</b>, Andrew, one of Scotland's first great naval
  commanders; flourished during the reign of James IV, and belonged to a
  family which for two generations had produced able and successful seamen.
  In 1497 he commanded the escort which accompanied Perkin Warbeck from
  Scotland. After doing considerable damage to English shipping, he was
  killed in an engagement with two ships which had been specially fitted
  out against him (1512).</p>

  <p><b>Barton</b>, Bernard, known as the Quaker poet, born at Carlisle
  1784, died 1849. In 1806 he removed to Woodbridge, in Suffolk, where he
  was long clerk in a bank. He published <i>Metrical Effusions</i> (1812);
  <i>Poems by an Amateur</i> (1818); <i>Poems</i> (1820); <i>Napoleon, and
  other Poems</i> (1822); <i>Poetic Vigils</i> (1824); <i>Devotional
  Verses</i> (1826); <i>A New-year's Eve, and other Poems</i> (1828);
  besides many contributions to the annuals and magazines. His poetry,
  though deficient in force, is pleasing, fluent, and graceful. Barton is
  chiefly remembered as the friend of Charles Lamb, with whom he began to
  correspond in 1822.</p>

  <p><b>Barton</b>, Elizabeth, a country girl born in 1506 at Aldington, in
  Kent (commonly called the Holy Maid or the Nun of Kent), who gained some
  notoriety in the reign of Henry VIII. She was subject to epileptic fits,
  and was persuaded by certain priests that she was a prophetess inspired
  by God. Among other things she prophesied that Henry, if he persisted in
  <!-- Page 411 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  marriage, would not be king for seven months longer, and would die a
  shameful death, and be succeeded by Catherine's daughter. On arrest the
  imposture was confessed, and Barton and six others were executed 5th May,
  1534.</p>

  born in 1832, died in 1888, whose labours have been of immense service in
  elucidating the older literature and language of his native country as
  well as in the field of the Romance tongues. Among his publications were
  editions of the <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, <i>Walther von der Vogelweide</i>,

  apocryphal books bears the name of Baruch. The Council of Trent gave it a
  place in the canon, but its authenticity was not admitted either by the
  ancient Jews or the early Christian fathers.</p>

  <p><b>Barwood</b>, a dyewood obtained from <i>Pterocarpus angolensis</i>,
  a tall tree of West Africa. It is chiefly used for giving orange-red dyes

  <p><b>Bary´ta</b>, oxide of barium (BaO) is found in nature associated
  with sulphuric acid as barium sulphate, heavy-spar or Barytes
  (BaSO<sub>4</sub>), and with carbon dioxide as barium carbonate or
  witherite (<span class="correction" title="Original reads 'BaCo'."
  >BaCO</span><sub>3</sub>). Baryta is a heavy greyish powder of specific
  gravity 4.7, obtained by burning barium in oxygen or from barium nitrate
  or barium carbonate. It has a strong affinity for water, and combines
  with it in the evolution of lead and the formation of barium hydroxide
  (Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub>). Barium oxide is manufactured in quantity for the
  preparation of barium dioxide (BaO<sub>2</sub>), from which oxygen was at
  one time obtained. (See <i>Oxygen</i>.) Baryta forms white crystalline
  salts with acids, which are all poisonous with the exception of barium
  sulphate. Barium hydroxide is soluble in water, forming a
  strongly-alkaline solution, Baryta water, which is much used in chemical
  analysis. Barium sulphate is a white substance insoluble in water and in
  acids, and is the source of most of the barium compounds.
  Artificially-prepared barium sulphate is used as a pigment, <i>Permanent
  White</i>, also in the paper industry and in vulcanizing rubber. Other
  salts of barium of importance are barium chloride, barium nitrate, and
  barium carbonate, used in pyrotechny and in glass manufacture.</p>

  <p><b>Barytes (American Barite)</b>, a rhombic mineral consisting of
  barium sulphate (specific gravity 4.5) occurring in veins and extensive

  <p><b>Basalt</b> (ba-sa<span class="x1"><span
  class="x3">&#xA8;</span></span>lt´), a well-known igneous rock occurring
  in the ancient trap and the recent volcanic series of rocks, but more
  abundantly in the former. It is a fine-grained, heavy, crystalline rock,
  consisting of felspar, augite, and <!-- Page 412 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page412"></a>[412]</span>magnetic iron, and
  sometimes contains a little olivine. Basalt is amorphous, columnar,
  tabular, or globular. The columnar form is straight or curved,
  perpendicular or inclined, sometimes nearly horizontal; the diameter of
  the columns from 3 to 18 inches, sometimes with transverse hemispherical
  joints, in which the convex part of one is inserted in the concavity of
  another; and the height from 5 to 150 feet. The forms of the columns
  generally are pentagonal, hexagonal, or octagonal. When decomposed it is
  found also in round masses, either spherical or compressed and
  lenticular. These rounded masses are sometimes composed of concentric
  layers, with a nucleus, and sometimes of prisms radiating from a centre.
  Fingal's Cave, in the Island of Staffa, furnishes a remarkable instance
  of basaltic columns. The pillars of the Giant's Causeway, Ireland,
  composed of this stone, and exposed to the roughest sea for ages, have
  their angles as perfect as those at a distance from the waves. Basalt
  often assumes curious and fantastic forms, as, for example, those masses
  popularly known as 'Samson's Ribs' at Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh, and 'Lot'
  and 'Lot's Wife' near the south coast of St. Helena.</p>

  <p><b>Baschi</b> (ba<span class="x1"><span

  friar of the convent of Montefalcone, founder and first general of the
  Capuchin branch of the Franciscans. He died at Venice, 1552.</p>

  <p><b>Bas´cinet</b>, or <b>Bas´net</b>, a light helmet, sometimes with,
  but more frequently without, a visor, in general use for English infantry
  in the reigns of Edward II and III and Richard II.</p>

  <p><b>Base</b>, in architecture, that part of a column which is between
  the top of the pedestal and the bottom of the shaft; where there is no
  pedestal, the part between the bottom of the column and the pavement. The
  term is also applied to the lower projecting part of the wall of a room,
  consisting of a plinth and its mouldings.</p>

  <p><b>Base</b>, in chemistry, a term applied to those compound substances
  which unite with acids to form salts. The most important bases are oxides
  of metals, and when brought in contact with acids their oxygen combines
  with the hydrogen of the acid to form water. They are divided into
  several sections, of which the most important are the alkalies. These
  substances are the hydrates of the so-called alkaline metals, and may be
  compared to water in which part of the hydrogen is replaced by a metallic
  radicle. Potash, for instance, is the hydrate of the metal potassium. The
  alkalies are readily soluble in water, restore the blue colour to
  reddened litmus, and give a green with red cabbage, dahlia, and other
  vegetable blues, and convert the yellow of turmeric into a brownish red.
  Most of the bases, however, are insoluble in water, and without any
  effect on vegetable colours. See <i>Alkali</i>; <i>Acids</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Base</b>, a term in tactics, signifying the original line on which
  an offensive army forms; or any safe position from which an army takes
  the field to invade an enemy's country; upon which it depends for its
  supplies, reinforcements, &amp;c.; to which it sends back its sick and
  wounded; and upon which it would generally fall back in case of reverse
  and retreat.</p>

  <p><b>Base-ball</b>, the national game of the United States of America.
  It holds the position there that is held by cricket in England. It is a
  scientific development of the old English game of 'rounders', and is
  played by nine players a side. A diamond-shaped space of ground, 90 feet
  on the side, is marked out, the corners being the 'bases'. One side takes
  the field and the other sends a man to bat. When the field side takes its
  place, the 'pitcher', standing inside the ground near the centre and in
  front of the batsman, delivers a ball to the batsman, who stands at the
  'home base' within a certain marked space, and who tries to drive it out
  of the reach of the fielders, and far enough out of the field to enable
  him to run round the bases, which scores a run. If he cannot run round
  all, he may stop at any one, and may be followed by another batsman. If
  the ball is caught by an opponent before touching the ground when the
  batsman is running, or if he is touched by the ball, he is out (also in
  several other cases), and when three on his side are put out, the field
  side take the bat. Nine of these innings make a game, which the highest
  score wins. The bat is of a cylindrical shape, not more than 2½ inches in
  diameter nor more than 42 inches long. The ball is about 9 inches in
  circumference and weighs 5 - 5¼ oz. Base-ball is not a very old game,
  having attained its present position only since about 1845. Many
  professional players now engage in it. Attempts have been made to
  introduce it into Britain and Australia, but with little
  success.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: <i>Official

  <p><b>Basedow</b> (bä'ze-d&#x14D;), John Bernhard, German educationalist,
  born in Hamburg 1723, died in 1790. After having gained considerable
  experience as a teacher, especially at the gymnasium of Altona, he
  published a number of works dealing with mental and moral philosophy, the
  teaching of religion and morality, &amp;c., some of which roused a great
  amount of discussion. His watchword was "Everything according to nature".
  In 1771 he was called to Dessau by Prince Leopold, and in 1774 took
  charge of an <!-- Page 413 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page413"></a>[413]</span>educational institution in which his views
  were to receive practical exemplification. This institution, which he
  called the <i>Philanthropinum</i>, was a school free from sectarian bias,
  and in which the pupils were to be disciplined in all
  studies&mdash;physical, intellectual, and moral. This school led to the
  establishment of some similar ones, though Basedow retired from it in
  1776, not having been very successful in the practical working out of his
  theories. His place was taken by Joachim Heinrich Campe (1746-1818). He
  henceforth devoted himself to authorship, writing especially on religious
  subjects. The chief feature of Basedow's system is the full development
  of the faculties of the young, in pursuance of the notions of Locke and
  Rousseau. His name still lives in the history of education, and his
  efforts were not without result.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Basel</b> (bä'zl; Fr. <i>Bâle</i>), a canton and city of
  Switzerland. The canton borders on Alsace and Baden, has an area of 177
  sq. miles, and a pop. of 222,000 (1916), nearly all speaking German. It
  is divided into two half-cantons, Basel city (Basel-Stadt) and Basel
  country (Basel-Land). The former consists of the city and its precincts,
  the remainder of the canton forming Basel-Land, the capital of which is
  Liestal. The whole canton belongs to the valley of the Rhine. The soil is
  generally well cultivated; and the climate in the low grounds allows of
  the cultivation of the vine and other fruits.&mdash;The city of
  <i>Basel</i> is 43 miles <span class="scac">N.</span> of Bern, and
  consists of two parts on opposite sides of the Rhine, and communicating
  by three bridges, one of them an ancient wooden structure, besides a
  railway bridge. The older portions are irregularly built with narrow
  streets, and are now surrounded with pleasant promenades where the old
  fortifications existed. Basel has an ancient cathedral, founded 1010,
  containing the tombs of Erasmus and other eminent persons; the fine
  modern church of St. Elizabeth; town hall (1508); a university, founded
  by Pius II in 1460; a seminary for missionaries; a bible society; a
  museum containing the valuable public library, pictures, &amp;c. The
  industries include silk ribbons (8000 hands), metal articles, tanning,
  paper, aniline dyes and other chemicals, brewing, &amp;c.; and the
  position of Basel, a little below where the Rhine becomes navigable and
  at the terminus of the French and German railways, has made it the
  emporium of a most important trade. At Basel was signed the treaty of
  peace between France and Prussia, 5th April, and that between France and
  Spain, 22nd July, 1795. Pop. (with suburbs), 137,000 (latest
  estimate).</p>

  <p><b>Basel, Council of</b>, a celebrated &oelig;cumenical council of the
  Church, convoked by Pope Martin V and his successor Eugenius IV. It was
  opened 14th Dec., 1431, under the presidency of the Cardinal Legate
  Juliano Cesarini of St. Angelo. The objects of its deliberations were to
  extirpate heresies (that of the Hussites in particular), to unite all
  Christian nations under the Catholic Church, to put a stop to wars
  between Christian princes, and to reform the Church. But its first steps
  towards a peaceable reconciliation with the Hussites were displeasing to
  the Pope, who authorized the Cardinal Legate to dissolve the Council.
  That body opposed the pretensions of the Pope, and, notwithstanding his
  repeated orders to remove to Italy, continued its deliberations under the
  protection of the Emperor Sigismund, of the German princes, and of
  France. On the Pope continuing to issue bulls for its dissolution, the
  Council commenced a formal process against him, and cited him to appear
  at its bar. On his refusal to comply with this demand the Council
  declared him guilty of contumacy, and, after Eugenius had opened a
  counter-synod at Ferrara, decreed his suspension from the papal chair
  (24th Jan., 1438). The removal of Eugenius, however, seemed so
  impracticable that some prelates, who till then had been the boldest and
  most influential speakers in the Council, including the Cardinal Legate
  Juliano, left Basel, and went over to the party of Eugenius. The
  Archbishop of Arles, Cardinal Louis Allemand, was now made first
  President of the Council, and directed its proceedings with much vigour.
  In May, 1439, it declared Eugenius, on account of his disobedience of its
  decrees, a heretic, and formally deposed him. Excommunicated by Eugenius,
  they proceeded, in a regular conclave, to elect the Duke Amadeus of Savoy
  to the papal chair. Felix V&mdash;the name he adopted&mdash;was
  acknowledged by only a few princes, cities, and universities. After this
  the moral power of the Council declined; its last formal session was held
  16th May, 1443, though it was not technically dissolved till 7th May,
  1449, when it gave in its adhesion to Nicholas V, the successor of
  Eugenius. The decrees of the Council of Basel are admitted into none of
  the Roman collections, and are considered of no authority by the Roman
  lawyers. They are regarded, however, as of authority in points of canon
  law in France and Germany, as their regulations for the Reformation of
  the Church have been adopted in the pragmatic sanctions of both
  countries, and, as far as they regard clerical discipline, have been
  actually enforced.</p>

  <p><b>Basi´diomycetes</b>, one of the two sub-classes of the Eumycetes or
  septate Fungi, including the bulk of the larger and more familiar
  saprophytic types, such as the Mushroom, Toad-stools, Shelf-fungi,
  Puff-balls, and Earth-stars, and also the important parasites known as
  the Rusts. They are characterized by their principal spores being
  produced externally, usually in fours, upon an organ called a
  <i>basidium</i>. The basidia are arranged in a continuous layer
  (hymenium), and are usually massed together upon a specialized
  fruit-body, of which an ordinary mushroom is a good example. The
  principal subdivisions of the group, with representative genera, are as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>A. Basidia septate (Proto-Basidiomycetes).</p>

  <p>1. Family Uredineæ (Rusts). Basidia transversely septate;
  teleutospores present; parasites. Puccinia, Phragmidium, Melampsora.</p>

  <p>2. Family Auricularineæ. Basidia transversely septate; no
  teleutospores; saprophytes. Auricularia.</p>

  <p>3. Family Tremellineæ. Basidia longitudinally septate; saprophytes.
  Tremella.</p>

  <p>B. Basidia not septate (Auto-Basidiomycetes).</p>

  <p>4. Family Exobasidiineæ. Parasites without fruit-body; basidia exposed
  on surface of host. Exobasidium.</p>

  <p>5. Family Dacryomycetineæ. Fruit-body soft; hymenium on its surface;
  saprophytes. Dacryomyces, Calocera.</p>

  <p>6. Group Hymenomycetes (several families). Hymenium generally on
  gills, in tubes, &amp;c.; saprophytes or, less often, parasites. Agaricus
  Polyporus, Hydnum.</p>

  <p>7. Group Gastromycetes (several families). Hymenium within a closed
  fruit-body, which does not open until the spores are ripe; saprophytes.
  Ithyphallus, Lycoperdon.</p>

  <p>The Ustilagineæ (Smuts) are often regarded as Basidiomycetes of a low
  type, but it is more probable that they are allied to the Unicellular
  Chytridineæ. The Basidiomycetes are the highest members of the Fungoid
  alliance; their relations to the lower groups are obscure.</p>

  <p><b>Basi´dium</b>, the characteristic spore-producing organ of the
  Basidiomycetes. Typically, e.g. in the Toad-stools, it is a club-shaped
  structure, produced at its free end into four slender processes, the
  <i>sterigmata</i>, each of which bears a <i>basidiospore</i> at its tip.
  The young basidium contains two nuclei, which later fuse; the
  fusion-nucleus then undergoes two successive divisions, involving a
  reduction of chromosomes, and each of the four resultant nuclei passes
  through a sterigma into a basidiospore. These latter are thus seen to be
  carpospores, comparable to those of Red Algæ, and to the ascospores of
  Ascomycetes. The basidia of Uredineæ (Rusts) and of some other primitive
  Basidiomycetes are septate, <!-- Page 415 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page415"></a>[415]</span>but otherwise agree with the type
  described above. See <i>Basidiomycetes</i>; <i>Carpospore</i>;
  <i>Rusts</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Basil.</b> See <i>Basilius</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Bas´il</b>, a labiate plant, <i>Oc&#x12D;mum basil&#x12D;cum</i>, a
  native of India, much used in cookery, especially in France, and known
  more particularly as sweet or common basil. Bush or lesser basil is <i>O.
  minimum</i>; wild basil belongs to a different genus, being the
  <i>Calamintha Clinopodium</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Basil, St.</b>, called the <i>Great</i>, one of the Greek fathers,
  was born in 329, and made in 370 Bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, where
  he died in 379. He was distinguished by his efforts for the regulation of
  clerical discipline, and, above all, his endeavours for the promotion of
  monastic life. The Greek Church honours him as one of its most
  illustrious saints, and celebrates his festival on 1st Jan. The vows of
  obedience, chastity, and poverty framed by St. Basil are essentially the

  </div>

  <p><b>Basil´ica</b>, originally the name applied by the Romans to their
  public halls, either of justice, of exchange, or other business. The plan
  of the basilica was usually a rectangle divided into aisles by rows of
  columns, the middle aisle being the widest, with a semicircular apse at
  the end, in which the tribunal was placed. The ground-plan of these
  buildings was generally followed in the early Christian churches, which,
  therefore, long retained the name of basilica, and it is still applied to
  some of the churches in Rome by way of distinction, and sometimes to
  other churches built in imitation of the Roman basilicas.</p>

  <p><b>Basilica´ta</b>, also called <b>Potenza</b>, an Italian province,
  extending north from the Gulf of Taranto, and corresponding pretty
  closely with the ancient Lucania. Area, 3855 sq. miles; pop. 489,574
  (1915).</p>

  <p><b>Basil´icon</b>, a name of several ointments, the chief ingredients
  of which are wax, pitch, resin, and olive-oil.</p>

  <p><b>Basil´icon Do´ron</b> (the royal gift), the title of a book written
  by King James I in 1599, containing a collection of precepts of the art
  of government. It maintains the claim of the king to be sole head of the
  Church. Printed at Edinburgh, 1603.</p>

  <p><b>Basil´ides</b> (d&#x113;z), one of the most famous Gnostic
  teachers, a native of Alexandria, who lived under the reigns of Adrian
  and Antoninus Pius about <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 120-40. He was
  well acquainted with Christianity, but mixed it up with the wildest
  dreams of the Gnostics, peopling the earth and the air with multitudes of
  <i>æons</i>. He was also greatly influenced by Platonism and
  Zoroastrianism. His disciples (Basilidians) were numerous in Syria,
  Egypt, Italy, and Gaul, but they are scarcely heard of after the fourth
  century.</p>

  <p><b>Bas´ilisk</b>, a fabulous creature formerly believed to exist, and
  variously regarded as a kind of serpent, lizard, or dragon, and sometimes
  identified with the cockatrice. It inhabited the deserts of Africa, and
  its breath and even its look was fatal. The name is now applied to a
  genus of saurian reptiles (Basiliscus), belonging to the family
  Iguanidæ;, distinguished by an elevated crest or row of scales, erectable
  at pleasure, which, like the dorsal fins of some fishes, runs along the
  whole length of the back and tail. The mitred or hooded basilisk (<i>B.
  <!-- Page 416 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page416"></a>[416]</span>mitr&#x101;tus</i>) is especially
  remarkable for a membranous bag at the back of the head, of the size of a
  small hen's egg, which can be inflated with air at pleasure. The other
  species have such hoods also, but of a less size. To this organ they owe
  their name, which recalls the basilisk of fable, though in reality they
  are exceedingly harmless and lively creatures. The <i>B. amboinensis</i>
  is a native of the Indian Archipelago, where it is much used for food. It
  frequents trees overhanging water, into which it drops when alarmed.</p>

  <p><b>Basil´ius I</b>, a Macedonian, Emperor of the East, born <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 820, died 886. He was of obscure origin, but
  having succeeded in gaining the favour of the Emperor Michael III, he
  became his colleague in the Empire, 866. After the assassination of
  Michael, 867, Basilius became emperor. Though he had worked his way to
  the throne by a series of crimes, he proved an able and equitable
  sovereign. The versatility, if not the depth, of his intellect is
  strikingly displayed in his <i>Exhortations to his Son Leo</i>, which are
  still extant.</p>

  <p><b>Basilius II</b>, Emperor of the East, born 958, died 1025. On the
  death of his father, the Emperor Romanus the Younger, in 963, he was kept
  out of the succession for twelve years by two usurpers. He began to reign
  in conjunction with his brother Constantine, 975. His reign was spent in
  almost perpetual warfare, his most important struggle being that which
  resulted in the conquest of Bulgaria, 1018.</p>

  <p><b>Ba´sin</b>, in physical geography, the whole tract of country
  drained by a river and its tributaries. The line dividing one river basin
  from another is the water-shed, and by tracing the various water-sheds we
  divide each country into its constituent basins. The basin of a loch or
  sea consists of the basins of all the rivers which run into it.&mdash;In
  geology a basin is any dipping or disposition of strata towards a common
  axis or centre, due to upheaval and subsidence. It is sometimes used
  almost synonymously with 'formation' to express the deposits lying in a
  certain cavity or depression in older rocks. The 'Paris basin' and
  'London basin' are familiar instances.</p>

  <p><b>Ba´singstoke</b>, a town of England, county of Hants, 18 miles
  <span class="scac">N.N.E.</span> of Winchester. It has a good trade in
  corn, malt, &amp;c., and now gives its name to one of the parliamentary
  divisions of the county. Pop. (1921), 12,718.</p>

  <p><b>Bas´kerville</b>, John, celebrated English printer and
  type-founder, born in 1706, died 1775. He settled at Birmingham as a
  writing-master, subsequently engaged in the manufacture of japanned
  works, and in 1750 commenced printing. From his press came highly-prized
  editions of ancient and modern classics, Bibles, prayer-books, &amp;c.,
  all beautifully-printed works. His first work was a <i>Virgil</i>,
  published in 1757, followed by his famous edition of Milton in 1758.</p>

  <p><b>Basket</b>, a vessel or utensil of wicker-work, made of interwoven
  osiers or willows, rushes, twigs, grasses, &amp;c. The process of
  basket-making is very simple, and appears to be well known among the very
  rudest peoples. The ancient Britons excelled in the art, and their
  baskets were highly prized in Rome.&mdash;Cf. T. Okey, <i>Introduction to
  the Art of Basket-making</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Basking-shark</b> (<i>Sel&#x103;ch&#x113; maxima</i> or
  <i>Cetorh&#x12B;nus maximus</i>), a species of shark, so named from its
  habit of basking in the sun at the surface of the water. It reaches the
  length of 40 feet, and its liver yields a large quantity of oil. It
  frequents the northern seas, and is known also as the sail-fish or
  sun-fish.</p>

  <p><b>Basques</b> (ba<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>sks), or <b>Biscayans</b> (in their own
  language, <i>Euscaldunac</i>), a remarkable race of people dwelling
  partly in the south-west corner of France (Basses-Pyrénées), but mostly
  in the north of Spain adjacent to the Pyrenees. They are probably
  descendants of the ancient Iberi, who occupied Spain before the Celts.
  They preserve their ancient language, former manners, and national
  dances, and make admirable soldiers, especially in guerrilla warfare.
  Their language is highly polysynthetic, and stands isolated from other
  tongues of Europe. There are eight principal dialects, which are not only
  distinguished by their pronunciation and grammatical structure, but
  differ even in their vocabularies. The Basques, who number about 600,000
  (450,000 in Spain, and 150,000 in France), occupy in Spain the provinces
  of Biscay, Guipuzcoa, and Al&#x103;va; in France parts of the departments
  of the Upper and Lower Pyrenees, Ariége, and Upper Garonne. The Basques
  are very religious and conservative in their religious practices.
  Ignatius Loyola and Francis Xavier de Navarre were Basques.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Basra</b>, <b>Bassora</b>, or <b>Basrah</b>, a city in Lower
  Mesopotamia, on the west bank of the Shat-el-Arab (the united stream of
  the Tigris and Euphrates), about 50 miles from its mouth, and nearly 300
  miles south-east of Bagdad. It is surrounded by a wall about 10 miles in
  circuit, from 20 to 25 feet thick; but much of the area enclosed is
  occupied by gardens, &amp;c. The houses are generally mean. A
  considerable transit trade is carried on here between the Turkish and
  Persian dominions and India, and since <!-- Page 417 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page417"></a>[417]</span>communication by
  steamer has been established with Bagdad and Bombay the prosperity of the
  town has greatly increased. The chief exports are: dates, camels and
  horses, wool and wheat; imports: coffee, indigo, rice, tissues, &amp;c.
  The inhabitants are estimated at 80,000; but in the eighteenth century
  they were said to number 150,000. The substitution of date and wheat
  cultivation for that of rice has rendered the place much more healthy.
  The ruins of the ancient and more famous Bassora&mdash;founded by Caliph
  Omar in 636, at one time a centre of Arabic literature and learning and
  regarded as 'the Athens of the East'&mdash;lie about 9 miles south-west
  of the modern town. The town was occupied by the British on 22nd Nov.,
  1914. The first through-train from Basra to Bagdad was run in Jan.,
  1920.</p>

  <p><b>Bas-relief</b> (bä´r&#x113;-l&#x113;f or bas´r&#x113;-l&#x113;f) or
  <b>Basso-Rilievo</b>, low-relief, a mode of sculpturing figures on a flat
  surface, the figures having a very slight relief or projection from the
  surface. It is distinguished from <i>haut-relief</i>
  (<i>alto-rilievo</i>), or high-relief, in which the figures stand
  sometimes almost entirely free from the ground. Bas-relief work has been
  described as 'sculptured painting', from the capability of disposing of
  groups of figures and exhibiting minor adjuncts, as in a painting. The
  finest specimen of bas-relief is the frieze around the cella of the
  Parthenon; large portions of it are to be seen in the British Museum.</p>

  <p><b>Bass</b> (b&#x101;s; from the It. <i>basso</i>, deep, low), in
  music, the lowest part in the harmony of a musical composition, whether
  vocal or instrumental. According to some it is the fundamental or most
  important part, while others regard the melody or highest part in that
  light. Next to the melody, the bass part is the most striking, the freest
  and boldest in its movements, and richest in effect.&mdash;<i>Figured
  bass</i>, a bass part having the accompanying chords suggested by certain
  figures written above or below the notes&mdash;the most successful system
  of shorthand scoring at present in use among organists and
  pianists.&mdash;<i>Fundamental bass</i>, the lowest note or root of a
  chord; a bass consisting of a succession of fundamental
  notes.&mdash;<i>Thorough bass</i>, the mode or art of expressing chords
  by means of figures placed over or under a given bass. Figures written
  over each other indicate that the notes they represent are to be sounded
  simultaneously, those standing close after each other that they are to be
  sounded successively. The common chord in its fundamental form is
  generally left unfigured, and accidentals are indicated by using sharps,
  naturals, or flats along with the figures.</p>

  <p><b>Bass</b> (ba<span class="x1"><span

  several genera, but originally belonging to a genus of sea-fishes
  (Labrax) of the perch family, distinguished from the true perches by
  having the tongue covered by small teeth and the preoperculum smooth.
  <i>L. lupus</i>, the only British species, called also sea-dace, and from

  25 to 30 lb., is much used for food, and is also known as rock-fish. Both
  species occasionally ascend rivers, and attempts have been made to
  cultivate British bass in freshwater ponds with success. Two species of
  black bass (<i>Micropt&#x115;rus salmoides</i> and <i>M. dolomieu</i>),
  American freshwater fishes, are excellent as food and give fine sport to
  the angler. The former is often called the large-mouthed black bass, from
  the size of its mouth. Both make nests and take great care of their eggs
  and young. The <i>Centropristis nigricans</i>, an American sea-fish of
  the perch family, and weighing 2 to 3 lb., is known as the sea-bass.</p>

  <p><b>Bass</b> (ba<span class="x1"><span

  trap-rock, at the mouth of the Firth of Forth, 3 miles from North
  Berwick, of a circular form, about 1 mile in circumference, rising
  majestically out of the sea to a height of 313 feet. It pastures a few
  sheep, and is a great breeding-place of solan geese. During the
  persecution of the Covenanters its castle, long since demolished, was
  used as a State prison, in which several eminent Covenanters were

  <p><b>Bas´tard</b>, a child begotten and born out of wedlock; an
  illegitimate child. By the civil and canon laws, and by the law of
  Scotland, a bastard becomes legitimate by the intermarriage of the
  parents at any future time. In some of the United States, bastards can be
  legitimized by subsequent marriage, in addition to which, however, the
  father must also recognize the child as his. By the laws of England a
  child, to be legitimate, must at least be <i>born</i> after the lawful
  marriage; it does not require that the child shall be begotten in
  wedlock, but it is indispensable that it should be born after marriage,
  no matter how short the time, the law presuming it to be the child of the
  husband. The only incapacity of a bastard is that he cannot be heir or
  next of kin to any one save his own issue. In England the maintenance of
  a bastard in the first instance devolves on the mother, while in Scotland
  it is a joint burden upon both parents. The mother is entitled to the
  custody of the child in preference to the father. See

  <p><b>Bastille</b> (ba<span class="x1"><span

  strong castle provided with towers, but as a proper name the State prison
  and citadel of Paris, which was built about 1370 by Charles V. It was
  ultimately used chiefly for the confinement of persons of rank who had
  fallen victims to the intrigues of the Court or the caprice of the
  Government. (See <i>Cachet, Lettres de</i>.) The capture of the Bastille
  by the Parisian mob, 14th July, 1789, was the opening act of the <!--
  Page 420 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page420"></a>[420]</span>Revolution. On that date the Bastille was
  surrounded by a tumultuous mob, who first attempted to negotiate with the
  Governor, Delaunay, but when these negotiations failed, began to attack
  the fortress. For several hours the mob continued their siege without
  being able to effect anything more than an entrance into the outer court
  of the Bastille; but at last the arrival of some of the Royal Guard with
  a few pieces of artillery forced the Governor to let down the second
  drawbridge and admit the populace. The Governor was seized, but on the
  way to the Hotel de Ville he was torn from his captors and put to death.
  The next day the destruction of the Bastille commenced. Not a vestige of
  it exists, but its site is marked by a column in the Place de la
  Bastille.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: François Ravaisson,

  and defending the adjacent <i>curtain</i>, or that portion of the wall
  extending from one bastion to another, and two <i>faces</i> making with
  each other an acute angle called the <i>salient angle</i>, and commanding
  the outworks and ground before the fortification. The distance between
  the two flanks is the <i>gorge</i>, or entrance into the bastion. The use

  books against Prelacy: <i>Elenchus Religionis Papisticæ</i>, <i>Flagellum

  <p><b>Basu´toland</b>, a native province and British South African
  possession, situated between the Orange Free State, Natal, Griqualand

  of the Bechuanas, and have made greater advances in civilization than
  perhaps any other South African race. In 1866 the Basutos, who had lived
  under a semi-protectorate of the British since 1848, were proclaimed
  British subjects, their country placed under the government of an agent,
  and in 1871 it was joined to Cape Colony. In 1879 the attempted
  enforcement of an Act passed for the disarmament of the native tribes
  caused a revolt under the chief Moirosi, which the Cape forces were
  unable to put down. When peace was restored Basutoland was separated from
  Cape Colony (1884), and is now governed by a Resident Commissioner under
  the High Commissioner for South Africa. Basutoland has an area of about
  11,716 sq. miles, much of it covered with grass, and there is but little
  wood. The climate is pleasant. The natives keep cattle, sheep, and
  horses, cultivate the ground, and export grain. The Basuto ponies, which
  originally were brought from Batavia by the Dutch in the eighteenth
  century, are famous. It is divided into eight districts, each under a

  <p><b>Bat</b>, one of the group of wing-handed, flying mammals, having
  the fore-limb peculiarly modified so as to serve for flight, and
  constituting the order Cheiroptera. Bats are animals of the twilight and
  darkness, and are common in temperate and warm regions, but are most
  numerous and largest in the tropics. All European bats are small, and
  have a mouse-like skin. The body of the largest British species,
  <i>Vespertilio noct&#x16D;la</i>, is less than that of a mouse, but its
  wings stretch about 15 inches. During the day <!-- Page 421 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page421"></a>[421]</span>it remains in caverns,
  in the crevices of ruins, hollow trees, and similar lurking places, and
  flits out at evening in search of food, which consists of insects.
  Several species of the same genus are common in North America. Many bats
  are remarkable for having a singular nasal cutaneous appendage, bearing
  in some cases a fancied resemblance to a horse-shoe. Bats may be
  conveniently divided into two sections&mdash;the insectivorous or
  carnivorous, comprising all European and most African and American
  species; and the fruit-eating, belonging to tropical Asia and Australia,
  with several African forms. An Australian fruit-eating bat
  (<i>Pter&#x14F;pus ed&#x16B;lis</i>), commonly known as the kalong or
  flying-fox, is the largest of all the bats; it does much mischief in
  orchards. At least two species of South American bats are known to suck
  the blood of other mammals, and thence are called 'vampire-bats'. All the
  British bats belong to the insectivorous group, the fruit-eating and
  blood-sucking bats being confined to warmer regions. There are fifteen
  species on the British list, but of these three are very rare. Among the
  most noteworthy forms are the greater and the lesser horse-shoe bats, in
  which the ears are nearly as long as the whole body. As winter
  approaches, in cold climates bats seek shelter in caverns, vaults,
  ruinous and deserted buildings, and similar retreats, where they cling
  together in large clusters, hanging head downwards by the feet, and
  remain in a torpid condition until the returning spring recalls them to
  active exertions. Bats generally bring forth two young. The parent shows
  a strong degree of attachment to her offspring, and, when they are
  captured, will follow them, and even submit to captivity herself rather
  than forsake her charge.</p>

  placed among the hills, and the houses are built of freestone, obtained
  from the neighbourhood. The Abbey Church, dating from the fifteenth
  century, ranks as one of the finest specimens of Perpendicular Gothic
  architecture. Bath is remarkable for its medicinal waters, the four
  principal springs yielding no less than 184,000 gallons of water a day;
  and the baths are both handsome and <!-- Page 422 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page422"></a>[422]</span>roomy. The temperature
  of the springs varies from 109° to 117° F. They contain carbonic acid,
  chloride of sodium and of magnesium, sulphate of soda, carbonate and
  sulphate of lime, &amp;c. Bath was founded by the Romans, and called by
  them <i>Aquæ Solis</i> (Waters of the Sun). Amongst the Roman remains
  discovered there have been some fine baths. The height of its prosperity
  was reached, however, in the eighteenth century, when Beau Nash was
  leader of the fashion and master of its ceremonies. Since then, though it
  still attracts large numbers of visitors, it has become the resort of
  valetudinarians chiefly. Jointly with Wells it is the head of a diocese,

  <p><b>Bath</b>, the immersion of the body in water, or an apparatus for
  this purpose.</p>

  <p><i>Ancient Baths.</i>&mdash;The use of the bath as an institution,
  apart from occasional immersion in rivers or the sea, is, as might be
  anticipated, an exceedingly old custom. Homer mentions the bath as one of
  the first refreshments offered to a guest; thus, when Ulysses enters the
  palace of Circe, a bath is prepared for him, and he is anointed after it
  with costly perfumes. No representation, however, of a bath as we
  understand it is given upon the Greek vases, bathers being represented
  either simply washing at an elevated basin, or having water poured over
  them from above. In later times, rooms, both public and private, were
  built expressly for bathing, the public baths of the Greeks being mostly
  connected with the gymnasia. Apparently, by an inversion of the later
  practice, it was customary in the Homeric epoch to take first a cold and
  then a hot bath; but the Lacedæmonians substituted the hot-air sudorific
  bath, as less enervating than warm water, and in Athens at the time of
  Demosthenes and Socrates the warm bath was considered by the more
  rigorous to be an effeminate custom. The fullest details we have with
  respect to the bathing of the ancients apply to its luxurious development
  under the Romans. Their bathing establishments consisted of four main
  sections: the undressing room, with an adjoining chamber in which the
  bathers were anointed; a cold room with provision for a cold bath; a room
  heated moderately to serve as a preparation for the highest and lowest
  temperatures; and the sweating-room, at one extremity of which was a
  vapour-bath and at the other an ordinary hot bath. After going through
  the entire course both the Greeks and Romans made use of strigils or
  scrapers, either of horn or metal, to remove perspiration, oil, and
  impurities from the skin. Connected with the baths were walks, covered
  race-grounds, tennis-courts, and gardens, the whole, both in the external
  and internal decorations, being frequently on a palatial scale. The group
  of the <i>Laocoon</i> and the <i>Farnese Hercules</i> were both found in
  the ruins of Roman baths.</p>

  <p><i>Modern Baths.</i>&mdash;With respect to modern baths, that commonly
  in use in Russia consists of a single hall, built of wood, in the midst
  of which is a powerful metal oven, covered with heated stones, and
  surrounded with broad benches, on which the bathers take their places.
  Cold water is then poured upon the heated stones, and a thick, hot steam
  rises, which causes the sweat to issue from the whole body. The bather is
  then gently whipped with wet birch rods, rubbed with soap, and washed
  with luke-warm and cold water; of the latter, some pailfuls are poured
  over his head; or else he leaps, immediately after this sweating-bath,
  into a river or pond, or rolls in the snow. The Turks, by their religion,
  are obliged to make repeated ablutions daily, and for this purpose there
  is, in every city, a public bath connected with a mosque. A favourite
  bath among them, however, is a modification of the hot-air sudorific bath
  of the ancients introduced under the name of 'Turkish' into other than
  Mahommedan countries. A regular accompaniment of this bath, when properly
  given, is the operation known as 'kneading', generally performed at the
  close of the sweating process, after the final rubbing of the bather with
  soap, and consisting in a systematic pressing and squeezing of the whole
  body, stretching the limbs, and manipulating all the joints as well as
  the fleshy and muscular parts. Public baths are now common in Europe, but
  the first English public baths and wash-houses of the kind now common in
  all cities were established in Liverpool and near the London docks in
  1844. In 1846 an Act was passed for their encouragement, and a series of
  statutes, known as 'The Baths and Wash-houses Acts 1846 to 1896',
  followed. The establishment of cheap swimming-baths was authorized in
  1878.</p>

  <p>The principal natural warm baths in England are at Bath, in
  Somersetshire (the hottest), and Buxton and Matlock, in Derbyshire. The
  temperature of the Bath springs ranges from 109° to 117° F., while that
  of the Buxton and Matlock waters scarcely exceeds 82°. The baths of
  Harrogate, which are strongly impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas,
  are also of great repute for the cure of obstinate cutaneous diseases,
  indurations of the glands, &amp;c. The most celebrated natural hot baths
  in Europe <!-- Page 423 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page423"></a>[423]</span>are those of Aix-la-Chapelle, and the
  various Baden, in Germany; Toeplitz, in Bohemia; Bagnières, Baréges, and
  Dax, in the south of France; and Spa, in Belgium. Besides the various
  kinds of water-bath with or without medication or natural mineral
  ingredients, there are also milk, oil, wine, earth, sand, mud, and
  electric baths, smoke-baths and gas-baths; but these are as a rule only
  indulged in after specific prescription.</p>

  <p>The practice of bathing as a method of cure in cases of disease falls
  under the head of hydropathy; but even when it is employed simply for
  pleasure or purification due regard should be paid to the physiological
  condition of the bather. In many cases cold bathing should be avoided
  altogether, especially by those who have any tendency to spitting of
  blood or consumption, by gouty people, or by those who have any latent
  visceral disease or apoplectic tendency. Wherever the bath is followed by
  shivering instead of by a healthy reactionary glow, it is undesirable;
  and a cold bath in the morning after any debauchery or excess in eating
  or drinking on the previous evening is exceedingly imprudent. Delicate
  persons and children ought not to bathe in the sea before ten or eleven
  o'clock in the morning, and in no case should bathing be indulged in
  after a long fast. In cold streams and rivers additional precautions
  should be taken, the cold plunge, when heated or fatigued, being
  frequently attended with fatal results. Even warm baths are not wholly
  free from danger; apoplexy and death having been known to follow a hot
  bath when entered with a full stomach. As a rule the temperature should
  not exceed 105°, and they should not be too long continued. Frequent
  indulgence in them has an enervating effect, though the majority of
  people need as yet no renewal of Hadrian's prohibitive legislation in
  this matter. See also <i>Douches</i>; <i>Thermæ</i>.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Bath, Knights of the</b>, an order of England, supposed to have
  been instituted by Henry IV on the day of his coronation, but allowed to
  lapse after the reign of Charles II till 1725, when George I revived it
  as a military order. By the book of statutes then prepared the number of
  knights was limited to the sovereign and thirty-seven knights companions;
  but the limits of the order were greatly extended in 1815, and again in
  1847, when it was opened to civilians. It now consists of three classes,
  each subdivided into (1) military members, (2) civil members, and (3)
  honorary members, consisting of foreign princes and officers. The first
  class consists of Knights of the Grand Cross (<span
  class="scac">G.C.B.</span>); the second of Knights Commanders (<span
  class="scac">K.C.B.</span>); and the third of Companions (<span
  class="scac">C.B.</span>). The Dean of Westminster is dean of the order.
  In 1917 the Companions of the order were given the privileges and
  precedence of Commanders, the badge being now worn round the neck. In
  1918 the statutes were amended in order to admit officers of the Royal
  Air Force to the military division. The ribbon of the order is crimson;
  the military badge a gold cross of eight points, with the lion of England
  between the four principal angles, and having in a circle in the centre
  the rose, thistle, and shamrock between three imperial crowns; motto:
  <i>Tria juncta in uno</i>. Stars are worn by the two first classes, with
  additional motto, <i>Ich dien</i>, for the military members only. See

  <p><b>Batholite</b>, a mass of igneous rock having no visible floor, and
  presumed to pass down into some region of the earth's crust where molten
  rocks at one time prevailed over all others. Granite blocks, like those
  of the Cairngorm Mountains in Scotland, or the long ridge of the Leinster
  Chain, which have intruded into their surroundings, are regarded as
  batholites the crests of which have become exposed by denudation. A
  batholite in its original molten condition may exist under any large area
  of volcanic activity, and the similarity of the igneous rocks sent to the
  surface over broad regions of the earth, constituting what are called
  'petrographical provinces', points to the existence of very considerable
  continuous rock-cauldrons in the crust.</p>

  <p><b>Bathom´eter</b>, an instrument, invented by C. Williams Siemens,

  <p><b>Bathori</b> (bä'to-r&#x113;), or <b>Bathory</b>, a Hungarian
  family, which gave Transylvania five princes, and Poland one of its
  greatest kings. The more important members were:&mdash;1. Stephen, born
  in 1532, elected Prince of Transylvania in 1571, on the death of Zapolya,
  and in 1575 King of Poland. He accomplished many internal reforms,
  recovered the Polish territories in possession of the Czar of Moscovy,
  and reigned prosperously till his death in 1586.&mdash;2. Sigismund,
  nephew of Stephen, educated by the Jesuits, became Prince of Transylvania
  in 1581, shook off the Ottoman yoke, and had begun to give hopes of
  reigning gloriously when he resigned his dominions to the Emperor Rudolph
  II, in return for two principalities in Silesia, a cardinal's hat, and a
  pension. Availing himself, however, of an invitation by the
  Transylvanians, he returned, and placed himself under the protection of
  the Porte, but was defeated by the Imperialists in every battle, and
  finally sent to Prague, where he died almost forgotten in 1613.&mdash;3.
  Elizabeth, niece of Stephen, King of Poland, and wife of Count Nadasdy,
  of Hungary. She is said to have bathed in the blood of 600 young girls in
  the hope of renewing her youth, and to have committed other enormities.

  its fortifications were dismantled and it was thrown open as a free port.
  It rapidly grew to be the main outlet for Transcaucasia; its harbour was

  connected by a military road with Kars; and finally, in July, 1886, the
  Russian <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Goverment'."

  importance as a naval and military station to Russia was unquestionably
  great; it is of most importance commercially as an outlet for the mineral
  oil of Baku. The water is of great depth close inshore, and the shipping
  lies under protection of the overhanging cliffs of the Gouriel Mountains.
  Batoum was abandoned by the Bolshevik Government in March, 1918, and

  One of them, Alexander, was Prince of Bulgaria from 1879 to 1886, and
  died in 1893. Another, Prince Henry, was married to Princess Beatrice of
  Great Britain in 1885, and died in 1896.</p>

  <p><b>Battenberg</b>, Prince Louis Alexander of, born 24th May, 1854, in

  eldest daughter of Princess Alice Maud, Grand-Duchess of Hesse-Darmstadt,
  and second daughter of Queen Victoria. He became rear-admiral in 1904,
  was second admiral of the Mediterranean fleet from 1906 to 1908,
  commanded the Atlantic fleet from 1908 to 1910, the 3rd and 4th divisions
  of the Home fleet in 1911, and was appointed Second Sea Lord in Nov.,
  1911, and First Sea Lord in Dec., 1912, in succession to Sir Francis
  Bridgeman. In October, 1914, however, in consequence of a campaign
  against alien enemies which culminated in an attack in the <i>Globe</i>
  on the First Sea Lord, he tendered his resignation to Mr. Winston
  Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, on the ground that his birth
  and parentage in some respects impaired his usefulness. In 1917 the king
  determined that those princes of his family who were his subjects and
  bore German names and titles should relinquish those titles and adopt
  British surnames, and Prince Louis adopted the title of Marquess of
  Milford Haven, and the surname of Mountbatten. He was the author of
  <i>Men-of-war Names, their Meaning and Origin</i> (1908). He was made a
  Privy Councillor in 1914, and was both a Civil and a Military Knight
  Grand Cross of the Bath. He died 11th Sept., 1921.</p>

  <p><b>Battering-ram</b>, an engine for battering down the walls of
  besieged places. The ancients employed two different engines of this
  kind&mdash;one suspended in a frame, the other movable on <!-- Page 426
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page426"></a>[426]</span>wheels or
  rollers. They consisted of a beam or spar with a massive metal head, and
  were set in motion either by a direct application of manual force or by
  means of cords passing over pulleys. Some are said to have been 120 feet
  or more in length, and to have been worked by 100 men. One is described
  as being 180 feet long, and having a head weighing 1½ tons. Smaller ones,
  manned by three or four soldiers, were also frequently employed. They
  were generally covered with a roof or screen for the protection of the
  workers. The battering-ram is mentioned by Ezekiel (iv, 2; xxi, 22), and
  the Romans learnt the use of it from the Greeks.</p>

  <p><b>Bat´tersea</b>, a municipal and parliamentary borough of London, in
  Surrey, in a low situation on the south bank of the Thames, nearly
  opposite Chelsea, with a fine public park extending over 185 acres. The
  district is associated with the names of Pope and Bolingbroke, and with
  the Wellington-Winchilsea duel. Battersea returns two members to
  Parliament. Pop. (municipal borough), (1921), 167,693.</p>

  <p><b>Bat´tery</b>, (1) any number of guns grouped for action in one
  place and under one control; (2) the tactical and administrative unit of
  the Royal Regiment of Artillery; (3) an entrenched work constructed as a
  position for guns in siege warfare.</p>

  <p>The Royal Regiment of Artillery is organized in batteries of horse,
  field, heavy, siege, and mountain artillery. These differ in the weight
  and type of gun with which they have to do, but the general principles of
  organization are the same. (See <i>Army</i>.) Nominally a battery
  consists of six guns with their attendant ammunition wagons (12) and
  certain other transport. A major commands the battery, and has a captain
  and three subalterns to assist him. For all purposes a battery is
  permanently organized in three sections, each of two guns and four
  wagons, under subaltern officers; while in action it is divided into two
  parts, (<i>a</i>) the fighting battery of six guns and six wagons;
  (<i>b</i>) the wagon line of the remaining wagons, under command of the
  captain. The change from march formation to that necessary for firing is
  termed 'coming into action'.</p>

  <p>Horse, field, and some heavy batteries are horse-drawn (six or eight
  horses to a gun), while other heavy batteries and siege-guns are drawn by
  mechanical transport or mounted on railway platforms. Mountain batteries
  are organized for pack transport only&mdash;either mules or
  carriers&mdash;all the material being specially constructed to this end.
  Among combinations with the word battery come the following: <i>battery
  commander</i>, the officer commanding a battery; <i>battery leader</i>,
  the senior subaltern, who receives and carries out the commander's orders
  in action; <i>battery-fire</i>, each gun of a battery firing in turn: as
  opposed to gun-fire, where each gun fires independently. See
  <i>Artillery</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Battery</b>, in criminal law, an assault by beating or wounding
  another. The least touching or meddling with the person of another
  against his will may be held to constitute a battery.</p>

  <p><b>Battery</b>, in electricity and galvanism, a combination of several
  jars or metallic plates. See <i>Daniell's Cell</i>; <i>Electric
  Battery</i>; <i>Secondary Cell</i>.</p>

  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>t-ya<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>n´y&#x113;), one of the oldest and most
  celebrated Hungarian families, traceable as far back as the Magyar
  invasion of Pannonia in the ninth century. Among later bearers of the
  name have been&mdash;Count Casmir Batthyanyi, who was associated with
  Kossuth, was Minister of Foreign Affairs in Hungary during the
  insurrection of 1849, and died in Paris 1854; Count Louis Batthyanyi,
  born 1809, of another branch of the family, was leader of the opposition
  in the Hungarian Diet until the breaking out of the commotions of 1848,
  when he took an active part in promoting the national cause; but on the
  entry of Windischgrätz into Pesth he was arrested and shot, 1849.</p>

  <p><b>Battle</b>, a combat between two armies. In ancient times and the
  Middle Ages the battleground was often chosen by agreement, and the
  battle was a mere trial of strength, a duel <i>en gros</i>; and as the
  armies of the ancients were imperfectly organized, and the combatants
  fought very little at a distance, after the battle had begun
  manu&oelig;vres were much more difficult, and troops almost entirely
  beyond the control of the general. Under these circumstances the battle
  depended almost wholly upon the previous arrangements and the valour of
  the troops. In modern times, however, the finest combinations, the most
  ingenious man&oelig;uvres, are rendered possible by the better
  organization of the armies, and it is the skill of the general rather
  than the courage of the soldier that now <!-- Page 427 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page427"></a>[427]</span>determines the event of
  a battle. Battles are distinguished as <i>offensive</i> or
  <i>defensive</i> on either side, but there is a natural and ready
  transition from one method to the other. The purely defensive attitude is
  condemned by tacticians except in cases where the only object desirable
  is to maintain a position of vital consequence, the weight of precedent
  being in favour of the dash and momentum of an attacking force even where
  opposed to superior forces. Where the greatest generals have acted upon
  the defensive, it has almost always been with the desire to develop an
  opportunity to pass to the offensive, and, having discovered their
  opponent's hand, to marshal against the enemy, exhausted with attack, the
  whole strength of their resources. Napoleon won more than one great
  victory by this method, and Wellington's reputation was largely based
  upon his skill in defensive-offensive operations. Tacticians have divided
  a battle into three periods, which are disposition, combat, and the
  decisive moment. In some measure they require distinct qualities in a
  commander, the intellect which can plot a disposition being by no means
  always of the prompt judgment passing to instant action which avails
  itself of the crucial moment to crush an enemy. Cooperation and mutual
  support of all arms and services is essential to success in a modern
  battle, which may occupy many days or even weeks and embrace a large area
  of country, e.g. the battle of the Marne, the battle of the Somme. This
  co-operation is ensured by the most careful and detailed arrangements
  being made beforehand, such arrangements even including the rehearsal of
  more important phases over ground prepared to represent the country over
  which the operations will eventually take place. The modern battle may
  be, and probably will be, a continuation of many
  operations&mdash;<i>offensive</i> and <i>defensive</i>&mdash;carried out
  by distinct and separate formations. The general scope of the operations
  as a whole will be planned by the supreme commander, while the choice of
  the methods to be used is left to the commander of the formations
  affected. See <i>Strategy</i>; <i>Tactics</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Battle</b>, a town in Sussex, so named from the battle of Hastings
  having been fought there. An abbey built by William the Norman has
  disappeared, but important remains of a later building exist on the same
  site; and there is an old church of great interest. Pop. (1921),
  2891.</p>

  <p><b>Battle</b> (or <b>Battel</b>), <b>Wager of</b>, an obsolete method,
  according to English law, of deciding civil or criminal cases by personal
  combat between the parties or their champions in presence of the court. A
  woman, a priest, a peer, or a person physically incapable of fighting
  could refuse such a trial. It was not abolished till 1819 (by the Statute
  of 59 George III, c. 46), but had long previously been in abeyance. See
  <i>Ordeal</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Battle-axe</b>, a weapon much used in war in the early part of the
  Middle Ages among knights. It is a weapon which affords hardly any guard,
  and the heavier the blow given with it the more the fighter is exposed;
  but its use was to some extent necessitated by the resistance of iron
  armour to all but heavy blows. In England and Scotland the battle-axe was
  much employed, the Lochaber-axe remaining a formidable implement of
  destruction in the hands of the Highlanders to a recent period.</p>

  <p><b>Battle Creek</b>, a town of the United States, in Michigan, at the

  <p><b>Bat´tlement</b>, a notched or indented parapet of a fortification,
  formed by a series of raised parts called <i>cops</i> or <i>merlons</i>,
  separated by openings called <i>crenelles</i> or <i>embrasures</i>, the
  soldier sheltering himself behind the merlon, while he fires through the
  embrasure. Battlements were originally military, but were afterwards used
  freely in ecclesiastical and civil buildings by way of ornament, on
  parapets, cornices, tabernacle work, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Battle-piece</b>, a painting representing a battle. Some of the
  greatest pieces of this kind are the <i>Battle of Constantine</i>, of

  reputation as a <!-- Page 428 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  police thought it necessary to deodorize them. Of a higher tone were his
  <i>Petits Poèmes en Prose</i>; followed in 1859 by a monograph on
  Théophile Gautier, in 1860 by <i>Les Paradis Artificiels</i> (opium and
  hashish studies), and in 1861 by <i>Wagner et Tannhäuser à Paris</i>. He
  died in 1867. The best English rendering of the <i>Fleurs du Mal</i> is

  Botanici</i> and <i>Theatrum Botanicum</i>. Linnæus gave his name to a
  genus of plants.</p>

  <p><b>Bauhin´ia</b>, a genus of plants, ord. Leguminosæ, usually lianes,
  found in the woods of hot countries, and often stretching from tree to

  philosopher, born in 1714 at Berlin; in 1740 was made professor of
  philosophy at Frankfort-on-the-Oder, and died there in 1762. He is the
  founder of æsthetics as a science, and the inventor of this name. His
  ideas were first developed in his <i>De Nonnullis ad Poema
  pertinentibus</i> (1735), and afterwards in the two volumes of his
  uncompleted <i>Æsthetica</i>, published 1750-8.</p>

  <p><b>Baur</b> (bour), Ferdinand Christian, German theologian, founder of
  the 'Tübingen School' of theologians and Hegelian thinkers, born in 1792.
  The publication of his first work, <i>Symbolism and Mythology, or The
  Natural Religion of Antiquity</i>, in 1824-5, led to his appointment as
  professor in the evangelical faculty of Tübingen University, a position
  occupied by him till his death in 1860. His chief works in the department
  of the history of Christian dogma are: <i>The Christian Gnosis, or The
  Christian Philosophy of Religion</i> (1835); <i>The Christian Doctrine of
  the Atonement</i> (1838); <i>The Christian Doctrine of the Trinity and
  the Incarnation</i> (1841-3); <i>The Compendium of and Lectures on the
  History of Christian Dogmas</i> (1847, 1865). To the department of New
  Testament criticism and the early history of Christianity belong the
  so-called <i>Pastoral Epistles of the Apostle Paul</i> (1835); <i>Paul
  the Apostle of Jesus Christ</i> (1845); <i>Critical Inquiries Concerning
  the Canonic Gospels</i> (1847); <i>A History of Christian Doctrine to the
  End of the Eighteenth Century</i> (1853-63). Baur's views in regard to
  the Church of the earliest times and the New Testament Scriptures have
  been very influential. He saw different and opposing tendencies at work
  in the Church of apostolic times, and believed that the New Testament
  mainly took form in the second century, the only genuine writings
  previous to <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 70 being the four great
  Pauline epistles and <i>Revelation</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Bauxite</b> (ba<span class="x1"><span
  class="x3">&#xA8;</span></span>k´s&#x12B;t), a rock resembling clay, but
  consisting of hydrated aluminium oxides, with, in good examples, a silica
  content of less than 2 per cent. Bauxite is mined at Les Baux in
  Provence, in Arkansas, and other places, including County Antrim, where
  it occurs between basaltic lavas. It is the source of commercial

  <p><b>Bava´ria</b> (Ger. <i>Bayern</i>; Fr. <i>Bavière</i>), previous to
  the changes caused by the European War (1914-8), a kingdom in the south
  of Germany, the second largest State of the <i>Reich</i>, composed of two
  isolated portions, the larger comprising about eleven-twelfths of the
  monarchy, having Würtemberg, Baden, &amp;c., on the west, while the
  smaller portion, the Pfalz or <!-- Page 429 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page429"></a>[429]</span>Palatinate, is separated from the other by
  Würtemberg and Baden, and lies west of the Rhine; total area, 30,346 sq.
  miles. The main political divisions are: Upper Bavaria (pop. 1,532,065;
  chief town, Munich, the capital of the country, pop. 596,467); Lower
  Bavaria (724,331); Palatinate (937,085); Upper Palatinate and Regensburg
  (600,284); Upper Franconia (661,862); Middle Franconia (930,868); Lower
  Franconia and Aschaffenburg (710,943); Sehwaben and Neuburg (789,853);
  total in (1919), 7,150,146. Next towns after Munich are Nürnberg,
  Augsburg, Würzburg, and Ratisbon (Regensburg). The main portion of the
  country is hilly; in the south, where it belongs to the Alps, it is
  mountainous; but north of the Alps and south of the Danube, which flows
  east through the country from Ulm to Passau, there is a considerable
  plateau, averaging about 1600 feet above the sea-level. The south
  frontier is formed by a branch of the Noric Alps, offsets from which
  project far into the plateau; principal peaks: the Zugspitze, 10,394
  feet, and the Watzmann, 9470 feet. The highest summits on the Bohemian
  (Austrian) frontier, belonging to the Böhmerwald Mountains, are the
  Rachel, 5102 feet, and the Arber, 5185 feet. Ranges of less elevation
  bordering on or belonging to the country are the Fichtelgebirge in the
  north-east, the Frankenwald, Rhöngebirge, and Spessart in the north, and
  the Steigerwald and Franconian Jura in the middle. The Palatinate is
  traversed by the north extremity of the Vosges Mountains, the highest
  peak being the Konigstuhl, 2162 feet. The greater part of the country
  belongs to the basin of the Danube, which is navigable, its tributaries
  on the south being the Iller, Lech, Isar, and Inn; on the north, the
  Wornitz, Altmühl, Nab, and Regen. The northern portion belongs to the
  basin of the Main, which receives the Regnitz and Saale, and is a
  tributary of the Rhine. The Palatinate has only small streams that flow
  into its boundary river the Rhine. The chief lakes of Bavaria are all on
  the higher part of the south plateau; the smaller within the range of the
  Alps. The Ammer-See is about 10 miles long by 2½ broad, 1736 feet above
  the sea; the Würm-See or Starnberger-See, about 12 miles long by 3 broad,
  1899 feet; and Chiem-See, 9 miles long by 9 to 4 broad, 1651 feet. The
  climate in general is temperate and healthy, though somewhat colder than
  the other South German States; yearly average about 47° F.</p>

  <p>As regards soil, Bavaria is one of the most fertile countries in
  Germany, producing the various cereals in abundance, the best hops in
  Germany, fruit, wine, tobacco, &amp;c., and having extensive forests.
  Lower Franconia (the Main valley) and the Palatinate are the great
  vine-growing districts. The celebrated Steinwein and Leistenwein are the
  produce of the slopes of the Steinberg and Marienberg at Würzburg (on the
  Main). The forests of Bavaria, chiefly fir and pine, yield a large
  revenue, much timber being annually exported, together with potash, tar,
  turpentine, &amp;c. The principal mineral products are salt, coal, and
  iron, some of the mining works belonging to the State. The minerals
  worked include copper, quicksilver, manganese, cobalt, porcelain clay,
  alabaster, graphite. Large numbers of horses and cattle are reared, as
  also sheep and swine. The return of cattle in 1917 showed 272,667 horses,
  3,896,702 cattle, and 616,464 sheep. The manufactures are individually
  mostly on a small scale. The principal articles manufactured are linens,
  woollens, cottons, leather, paper, glass, earthen and iron ware,
  jewellery, &amp;c. The optical and mathematical instruments made are
  excellent. A most important branch of industry is the brewing of beer,
  for which there are upwards of 7000 establishments, producing over 300
  millions of gallons a year. The distilleries produce over 4 millions of
  gallons of alcohol. A number of the people maintain themselves by the
  manufacture of articles in wood, and by felling and hewing timber. The
  trade of Bavaria in home produce exported and goods imported for
  consumption in the country is not large. Principal exports: corn, timber,
  wine, cattle, glass, hops, fruit, beer, wooden wares, &amp;c. The chief
  imports are sugar, coffee, cotton, rice, spices, dye-stuffs, silk and
  silk goods, lead, &amp;c. From its position Bavaria has a considerable
  transit trade. The Konig Ludwig Canal connects the Main at Bamberg with
  the Altmühl a short distance above its embouchure in the Danube, thus
  establishing water communication between the North Sea and the Black Sea.
  The railway system has a total mileage of 5290, mostly belonging to the
  State.</p>

  <p>Education is in a less satisfactory condition than in most German
  States. There are about 7500 elementary schools, at which attendance is
  compulsory up to fourteen years of age. There are three universities, two
  of which (Munich and Würzburg) are Roman Catholic, and one (Erlangen)
  Protestant. In art Bavaria is best known as the home of the Nürnberg
  school, founded about the middle of the sixteenth century by Albert
  Dürer. Hans Holbein is also claimed as a Bavarian; and to these have to
  be added the eminent sculptors Kraft and Vischer, both born about the
  middle of the fifteenth century. The restoration of the reputation of
  Bavaria in art was chiefly the work of Ludwig I, under whom the capital
  became one of the most prominent seats of the fine arts in Europe. The
  religion of the State is Roman Catholicism, over <!-- Page 430 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page430"></a>[430]</span>70 per cent of the
  population being Roman Catholics. All citizens, whatever their creed,
  possess the same civil and political rights. The dioceses of Bavaria
  comprise two Roman Catholic archbishopries, Munich and Bamberg; and six
  bishopries, Augsburg, Ratisbon, Eichstädt, Passau, Würzburg, and
  Spires.</p>

  <p>For over a century Bavaria was a kingdom, and the crown hereditary in
  the male line of the descendants of the ancient Counts of Wittelsbach.
  The executive power was vested in the king, but his ministers were
  responsible for his acts. The legislature consisted of two
  chambers&mdash;one of senators, composed of princes of the royal family,
  the great officers of the State, the two archbishops, the heads of
  certain noble families, and certain members appointed by the Crown; the
  other of deputies, 163 in number, elected by direct and secret vote, and
  calculated at the rate of 1 for every 38,000 inhabitants. The lower
  chamber was elected for six years. The Budget for each of the years 1916
  and 1917 balanced at £12,183,411; for 1918 and 1919 at £42,639,595; the
  public debt on 1st July, 1917, was £128,719,000, £98,179,000 being
  railway debt. The army (peace footing, 72,000) was raised by
  conscription&mdash;every man being liable to serve from the 1st of
  January of the year in which he completes his twentieth year. In time of
  peace the army was under the command of the King of Bavaria, but in time
  of war under that of the Emperor of Germany, as commander-in-chief of the
  whole German army.</p>

  <p>As a result of the revolutionary movement in Nov., 1918, the Bavarian
  dynasty was deposed and a republican form of government set up. The
  provisional constitution, made public on 7th Jan., 1919, established a
  Socialist Republic in Bavaria. The supreme power lies with the people;
  the Diet consists of one chamber; the suffrage is universal; the
  privileges of birth and caste are abolished. The supreme executive power
  is exercised by the ministry as a whole. The Church is separated from the
  State, and all religious associations have equal rights.</p>

  <p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The Bavarians take their name from the Boii, a
  Celtic tribe whose territory was occupied by a confederation of Germanic
  tribes, called after their predecessors Boiarii. These were made
  tributary first to the Ostrogoths, and then to the Franks; and on the
  death of Charlemagne his successors governed the country by lieutenants
  with the title of margrave, afterwards converted (in 921) into that of
  duke. In 1070 Bavaria passed to the family of the Guelphs, and in 1180 by
  imperial grant to Otho, Count of Wittelsbach, founder of the dynasty
  reigning until 1918. In 1623 the reigning duke was made one of the
  Electors of the empire. Elector Maximilian II joined in the War of the
  Spanish Succession on the side of France, and this led, after the battle
  of Blenheim, 1704, to the loss of his dominions for the next ten years.
  His son, Charles Albert, likewise lost his dominions for a time to
  Austria, but they were all recovered again by Charles's son, Maximilian
  III (1745). In the wars following the French revolution Bavaria was in a
  difficult position between France and Austria, but in the end joined
  Napoleon, from whom its Elector Maximilian IV received the title of king
  (1805), a title afterwards confirmed by the treaties of 1814 and 1815.
  King Maximilian I was succeeded by his son, Ludwig (or Louis) I, under
  whom various circumstances helped to quicken a desire for political
  change. Reform being refused, tumults arose in 1848, and Ludwig resigned
  in favour of his son, Maximilian II, under whom certain modifications of
  the constitution were carried out. At his death in 1864 he was succeeded
  by Ludwig II. In the war of 1866 Bavaria sided with Austria, and was
  compelled to cede a small portion of its territory to Prussia, and to pay
  a war indemnity of £2,500,000. Soon after Bavaria entered into an
  alliance with Prussia, and in 1867 joined the Zollverein. In the
  Franco-German War of 1870-1 the Bavarians took a prominent part, and it
  was at the request of the King of Bavaria, on behalf of all the other
  princes and the senates of the free cities of Germany, that the King of
  Prussia agreed to accept the title of Emperor of Germany. From Jan.,
  1871, to 1918 Bavaria formed part of the German Empire, and was
  represented in the Bundesrath by six, and in the Reichstag by forty-eight
  members. The eccentricity early displayed by Ludwig II developed to such
  an extent that in June, 1886, he was placed under control, and a regency
  established under Prince Luitpold (Leopold). The change was almost
  immediately followed by the suicide of the king, and as Prince Otto, the
  brother and heir of the late king, was insane, the regency was continued.
  Prince Luitpold died on 12th Dec., 1912, and his son, Ludwig, became
  regent. On 5th Nov., 1913, the prince was proclaimed king, under the name
  of Ludwig III, in succession to his cousin, King Otto, who was declared
  incapable of ruling. King Otto died on 12th Oct., 1916. Ludwig III
  abdicated in Nov., 1918, and the Bavarian Government was taken over by a
  cabinet under the leadership of Kurt Eisner. Eisner was assassinated in
  Feb., 1919, and a struggle ensued between the moderate Socialists and the
  extremists of the Left. The moderate party, however, returned to power in
  May, 1919.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: S. Riezler,

  divines of the seventeenth century, born in Rowton, Shropshire, 1615;
  ordained in 1638; parish minister of Kidderminster in 1640. The
  imposition of the oath of universal approbation of the doctrine and
  discipline of the Church of England (the <i>et cætera oath</i>) detached
  him from the Establishment. After the battle of Naseby he accepted the
  chaplaincy of Colonel Whalley's regiment. He can scarcely be said,
  however, to have separated as yet in spirit from the Establishment. He
  upheld the monarchy, condemned the execution of the king and the election
  of Cromwell, preached against the Covenant and against separatists and
  sectaries, but his piety won him the respect of all parties. At the
  Restoration he became king's chaplain, but declined the bishopric of
  Hereford, and on the passage of the Act of Uniformity threw in his lot
  entirely with the nonconformists. In 1685 he was arrested, refused a
  hearing by Jeffreys, and imprisoned. After his release he lived in
  retirement till his death in 1691. He left about 150 treatises, of which
  his <i>Saints' Everlasting Rest</i>, <i>Call to the Unconverted</i>, and
  <i>Reformed Pastor</i> have been the most popular.&mdash;<span

  Bayard, near Grenoble, in Southern France. At the age of eighteen he
  accompanied Charles VIII to Italy, and in the battle of Fornovo took a
  standard. At the beginning of the reign of Louis XII, in a battle near
  Milan, he entered the city at the heels of the fugitives, and was taken
  prisoner, but released by Ludovico Sforza without ransom. In Apulia he
  killed his calumniator, Sotomayor, and afterwards defended a bridge over
  the Garigliano singly against the Spaniards, <!-- Page 432 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page432"></a>[432]</span>receiving for this
  exploit as a coat of arms a porcupine, with the motto <i>Vires agminis
  unus habet</i> ('one has the strength of a band'). He distinguished
  himself equally against the Genoese and the Venetians, and, when Julius
  II declared himself against France, went to the assistance of the Duke of
  Ferrara. He was severely wounded at the assault of Brescia, but returned,
  as soon as cured, to the camp of Gaston de Foix, before Ravenna, and
  after new exploits was again dangerously wounded in the retreat from
  Pavia. In the war commenced by Ferdinand the Catholic he displayed the
  same heroism, and the fatal reverses which embittered the last years of
  Louis XII only added to the personal glory of Bayard. When Francis I
  ascended the throne he sent Bayard into Dauphiné to open a passage over
  the Alps and through Piedmont. Prosper Colonna lay in wait for him, but
  was made prisoner by Bayard, who immediately after further distinguished
  himself in the battle of Marignano. After his defence of Mézières against
  the invading army of Charles V he was saluted in Paris as the saviour of
  his country, receiving the honour paid to a prince of the blood. His
  presence reduced the revolted Genoese to obedience, but failed to prevent
  the expulsion of the French after the capture of Lodi. In the retreat the
  safety of the army was committed to Bayard, who, however, was mortally
  wounded by a stone from a blunderbuss in protecting the passage of the
  Sesia. He kissed the cross of his sword, confessed to his squire, and
  died, 30th April, 1524. He was buried in a church of the Minorites, at

  writer, the son of a Calvinist preacher, born at Carlat (Languedoc) in
  1647, died at Rotterdam 1706. A statue in his honour was erected at
  Pamiers in 1906. He studied at Toulouse, and was employed for some time
  as a private tutor at Geneva and Rouen. He went to Paris in 1674, and
  soon after was appointed professor of philosophy at Sedan. Six years
  after he removed to Rotterdam, where he filled a similar chair. The
  appearance of a comet, in 1680, which occasioned an almost universal
  alarm, induced him to publish, in 1682, his <i>Pensées Diverses sur la
  Comète</i>, a work full of learning, in which he discussed various
  subjects of metaphysics, morals, theology, history, and politics. It was
  followed by his <i>Critique Générale de l'Histoire du Calvinisme de
  Maimbourg</i>. This work excited the jealousy of his colleague, the
  theologian Jurieu, and involved Bayle in many disputes. In 1684 he
  undertook a periodical work, <i>Nouvelles de la République des
  Lettres</i>, containing notices of new books in theology, philosophy,
  history, and general literature. This publication, which lasted for three
  years, added much to his reputation as a philosophical critic. In 1693
  Jurieu succeeded in inducing the magistrates of Rotterdam to remove Bayle
  from his office. He now devoted all his attention to the composition of
  his <i>Dictionnaire Historique et Critique</i>, which he first published
  in 1696, in 2 vols. fol. It is a vast storehouse of facts, discussions,
  and opinions, and though it was publicly censured by the Rotterdam
  consistory for its frequent impurities, its pervading scepticism, and
  tacit atheism, it long remained a favourite book both with literary men
  and with men of the world. The articles in his dictionary, in themselves,
  are generally of little value, and serve only as a pretext for the notes,
  in which the author displays, at the same time, his learning and the
  power of his logic. The best editions are that of 1740, in 4 vols. fol.
  (Amsterdam and Leyden), and that in 16 vols., published in 1820-4 at

  Kororarika, the first European settlement in New Zealand.&mdash;Also a
  large bay formed by the Gulf of St. Lawrence, on the west coast of
  Newfoundland. See <i>New Zealand</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Bay´onet</b> (Fr. <i>baïonnette</i>), a straight, sharp-pointed
  weapon, invented by a Frenchman (probably a native of Bayonne) in the
  seventeenth century. A bayonet was originally screwed into the muzzle of
  the firelock, converting it into a short pike. This system, which
  practically precluded any further use of the firelock as such, was later
  improved by a Scotchman, who fitted the weapon with a socket and bolt,
  enabling it to <!-- Page 434 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page434"></a>[434]</span>be placed over the muzzle of the musket
  instead of being screwed into it. The firelock could then be used for
  both missile and shock action, according to requirements. The bayonet
  replaced the pike in the English army after the revolution of 1690. The
  length, shape, and weight of the bayonet have varied considerably at
  different periods and in different countries; that at present in use in
  the British army is a short sword-shaped weapon, 1 foot 6 inches long and
  weighing about 1 pound. In war it is considered that an attack with the
  bayonet or the immediate threat of one is a necessary preliminary to a
  successful assault.</p>

  <p><b>Bayonne</b> (ba<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>-yon), a well-built fortified town, the
  largest in the French department Basses-Pyrénées, at the confluence of
  the Nive and the Adour, about 2 miles from their mouth in the Bay of
  Biscay; with a citadel commanding the harbour and city, a
  cathedral&mdash;a beautiful ancient building&mdash;shipbuilding and other
  industries, and a considerable trade. Among the lower class the Basque
  language is spoken. Catherine de' Medici had an important interview with
  the Duke of Alva in Bayonne, June, 1565, at which it is said the massacre
  of St. Bartholomew was arranged. It was also the scene of the abdication
  of Charles IV of Spain in favour of Napoleon (1808). In 1814 the British
  forced the passage of the Nive and invested the town, from which the
  French made a desperate but unsuccessful sortie. Pop. 27,886.</p>

  <p><b>Bay-window</b>, a window forming a recess or bay in a room,
  projecting outwards, and rising from the ground or basement on a plan
  rectangular, semi-octagonal, or semi-hexagonal, but always
  straight-sided. One of the finest examples of bay-windows is that of the
  banqueting-hall at Hampton Court. The term is, however, also often
  employed to designate a <i>bow-window</i>, which more properly forms the
  segment of a circle, and an <i>oriel-window</i>, which is supported on a
  kind of bracket, and is usually on the first floor.</p>

  <p><b>Baza</b> (bä´tha<span class="x1"><span

  <p><b>Bazaine</b> (ba<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>-z&#x101;n), François Achille, French
  general, born 1811, died 1888. He entered the army as a private soldier
  in 1831, and served in Algeria with distinction, gaining the cross of the
  Legion of Honour, and rising to the rank of lieutenant. He next went to
  Spain and fought in the Foreign Legion against the Carlists; and in 1839
  returned to Algeria, where he eventually held the rank of colonel (1850).
  He was next engaged in the Crimean War, being at first commander of a
  brigade and then general of division, leading the French troops sent to
  attack the fortress of Kinburn (1855). He did good service also in the
  Italian war of 1859, being actively engaged in the battle of Solferino.
  His military reputation was increased by the part he took in the Mexican
  expedition (1862-4), in which he led the first division under Forey, and
  when this general was recalled became commander-in-chief of the French
  forces in Mexico and marshal of France. His loyalty, however, to the
  cause of the Emperor Maximilian was very doubtful. In 1870 he took
  command of the <!-- Page 435 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page435"></a>[435]</span>army of the Rhine, or the third army
  corps, in the Franco-German War, collected a very large army in the
  neighbourhood of Metz, and had the intention of joining his forces with
  those of MacMahon at Châlons. He found this impossible, however,
  especially after Gravelotte, and was forced into Metz, where he
  capitulated after a seven weeks' siege, with an army of 175,000 men. For
  this act he was tried by court-martial in 1871, found guilty of treason,
  and condemned to death. The sentence was commuted to twenty years'
  seclusion in the Isle of St. Marguerite, from which he escaped in 1874,
  and retired to Spain. He published <i>Épisodes de la Guerre de
  1870</i>.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: La Brugère,
  <i>L'Affaire Bazaine</i>; Comte d'Herisson, <i>La Légende de

  <p><b>Bazar´</b>, or <b>Bazaar´</b>, in the East an exchange,
  market-place, or place where goods are exposed for sale, usually
  consisting of small shops or stalls in a narrow street or series of
  streets. These bazar-streets are frequently shaded by a light material
  laid from roof to roof, and sometimes are arched over. Marts for the sale
  of miscellaneous articles, chiefly fancy goods, are now to be found in
  most European cities, bearing the name of <i>bazars</i>. The term bazar
  is popularly applied to a sale of miscellaneous articles, mostly of fancy
  work, and contributed gratuitously, in furtherance of some charitable or
  other purpose.</p>

  <p><b>Bazar´jik</b>, now officially called Dobritsh (q.v.).</p>

  <p><b>Bazigars´</b>, a tribe of Indians dispersed throughout the whole of
  Hindustan mostly in wandering tribes. They are divided into seven castes;
  their chief occupation is that of jugglers, acrobats, and tumblers, in
  which both males and females are equally skilful. They present many
  features analogous to the gipsies of Europe, and like these each clan has
  its king.</p>

  <p><b>Bazin</b>, René, French novelist, born 1853. For some time he was
  professor of law in the Catholic University of Angers. His literary
  reputation was established by <i>Une Tache d'Encre</i>. His other novels
  include <i>La Terre qui meurt</i>, <i>De Toute son Âme</i>, <i>Les
  Oberlé</i>, <i>Les Noellet</i>, <i>Davidée Birot</i>, all of which have
  been translated into English by Dr. A.&nbsp;S. Rappoport. He has also written
  <i>Questions littéraires et sociales</i>, &amp;c. Bazin was elected a
  member of the Académie Française in 1903.</p>

  <p><b>Bazoche</b> (ba<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>-zosh´), or <b>Basoche</b> (a corruption
  of <i>Basilica</i>), a brotherhood formed by the clerks of the Parliament
  of Paris at the time it ceased to be the grand council of the French
  king. They had a king, chancellor, and other dignitaries; and certain
  privileges were granted them by Philip the Fair early in the fourteenth
  century, as also by subsequent monarchs. They had an annual festival,
  having as a principal feature dramatic performances in which satirical
  allusions were freely made to passing events. These farces or satires
  were frequently interdicted, but they had a considerable influence on the
  French drama. The Bazoche took an active part in the French Revolution,
  but the order was suppressed by the decree of 13th Feb., 1791.</p>

  <p><b>Bdellium</b> (del´i-um), an aromatic gum resin brought chiefly from
  Africa and India, in pieces of different sizes and figures, externally of
  a dark reddish brown, internally clear, and not unlike glue. To the taste
  it is slightly bitterish and pungent; its odour is agreeable. It is used
  as a perfume and a medicine, being a weak deobstruent. Indian bdellium is
  the produce of <i>Balsamodendron Roxburghii</i>; African of <i>B.
  africanum</i>; Egyptian bdellium is obtained from the doum palm; and
  Sicilian is produced by <i>Daucus gummifer</i>, a species of the genus to
  which the carrot belongs. The bdellium mentioned in <i>Gen.</i> ii, 12,
  was apparently a precious stone, perhaps a pearl. See <i>Myrrh</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Beaches, Raised</b>, a term applied to those long, terraced, level
  pieces of land, consisting of sand and gravel, and containing marine
  shells, now, it may be, a considerable distance above and away from the
  sea, but bearing sufficient evidences of having been at one time
  sea-beaches. In Scotland such a terrace has been traced extensively along
  the coasts at about 25 feet above the present sea-level.</p>

  <p><b>Beachy Head</b>, a promontory in the south of England, on the coast
  of Sussex, rising 575 feet above sea-level, with a revolving light,
  visible in clear weather from a distance of 28 miles. A naval battle took
  place here, 30th June, 1690, in which a French fleet under Tourville
  defeated an English and Dutch combined fleet under Lord Torrington.</p>

  <p><b>Beacon</b> (b&#x113;´kon), an object visible at some distance, and
  serving to notify the presence of danger; commonly applied to a
  fire-signal set on a height to spread the news of hostile invasion or
  other great event; and also applied to a mark or object of some kind
  placed conspicuously on a coast or over a rock or shoal at sea for the
  guidance of vessels, often an iron structure of considerable height.</p>

  <p><b>Beaconsfield</b> (b&#x113;´konz-f&#x113;ld), a village of
  Buckinghamshire, the parish church of which contains the remains of
  Edmund Burke, whose seat was in the neighbourhood; while a marble
  monument to the poet Waller, who owned the manor, is in the churchyard.
  It gave the title of earl to the English statesman and novelist Benjamin
  Disraeli. Pop. (1921), 3642.</p>

  <p><b>Beaconsfield</b>, formerly known as Du Toit's Pan, a town of Cape
  Province about a mile to the east of Kimberley, of which it forms a

  <p><b>Beaconsfield</b>, Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of, an eminent English
  statesman and novelist, of Jewish extraction; eldest son of Isaac
  D'Israeli, author of the <i>Curiosities of Literature</i>; born in London
  in 1804, died there in 1881, buried at Hughenden. He attended for a time
  a private school, and was first destined for the law, but showing a
  decided taste for literature he was allowed to follow his inclination. In
  1826 he published <i>Vivian Grey</i>, his first novel; and subsequently
  travelled for some time, visiting Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Syria, and
  gaining experiences which were afterwards reproduced in his books. His
  travels and impressions are embodied in a volume of letters addressed to
  his sister and his father. In 1831 another novel, <i>The Young Duke</i>,
  came from his pen. It was followed at short intervals by <i>Contarini
  Fleming</i>, <i>Alroy</i>, <i>Henrietta Temple</i>, <i>Venetia</i>,
  <i>The Revolutionary Epic</i> (a poem), &amp;c. In 1832, and on two
  subsequent occasions, he appeared as candidate for the representation of
  High Wycombe, with a programme which included vote by ballot and
  triennial parliaments, but was unsuccessful. His political opinions
  gradually changed: in 1835 he unsuccessfully contested Taunton as a Tory.
  In 1837 he gained an entrance to the House of Commons, being elected for
  Maidstone. His first speech in the House was treated with ridicule; but
  he finished with the prophetic declaration that the time would come when
  they would hear him. During his first years in Parliament he was a
  supporter of Peel; but when Peel pledged himself to abolish the
  corn-laws, Disraeli became the leader of the protectionists. About this
  time he became a leader of what was known as the 'Young England' party,
  the most prominent characteristic of which was a sort of sentimental
  advocacy of feudalism. This spirit showed itself in his two novels of
  <i>Coningsby</i> and <i>Sybil</i>, published respectively in 1844 and
  1845. Having acquired the manor of Hughenden, in Buckinghamshire, he was
  in 1847 elected for this county, and he retained his seat till raised to
  the peerage nearly thirty years later. His first appointment to office
  was in 1852, when he became Chancellor of the Exchequer under Lord Derby.
  The following year, however, the ministry was defeated. He remained out
  of office till 1858, when he again became Chancellor of the Exchequer,
  and brought in a Reform Bill which wrecked the Government. During the
  time the Palmerston Government was in office Disraeli led the opposition
  in the Lower House with conspicuous ability and courage. In 1866 the
  Liberals resigned, and Derby and Disraeli came into power, the latter
  being again Chancellor of the Exchequer. They immediately brought in, and
  carried, after a violent and bitter struggle, a Reform Bill on the basis
  of household suffrage. In 1868 he became Premier on the resignation of
  Lord Derby, but his tenure of office was short. In 1874 he again became
  Prime Minister with a strong Conservative majority, and he remained in
  power for six years. This period was marked by his elevation to the
  peerage in 1876 as Earl of Beaconsfield, and by the prominent part he
  took in regard to the Eastern question and the conclusion of the Treaty
  of Berlin in 1878. In 1880 Parliament was rather suddenly dissolved, and,
  the new Parliament showing an overwhelming Liberal majority, he resigned
  office, though he still retained the leadership of his party. Within a
  few months of his death the publication of a novel called <i>Endymion</i>
  (his last, <i>Lothair</i>, had been published ten years before) showed
  that his intellect was still vigorous. Among others of his writings,
  besides those already mentioned, are: <i>A Vindication of the English
  Constitution</i> (1834); <i>Alarcos, a Tragedy</i> (1839); and <i>Lord
  George Bentinck, a Political Biography</i> (1852).&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Bead</b> (b&#x113;d), originally a prayer; then a small perforated
  ball of gold, pearl, amber, glass, or the like, to be strung on a thread,
  and used in a rosary by Roman Catholics in numbering their prayers, one
  bead being passed at the end of each ejaculation or short prayer; finally
  any such small ornamental body. The use of beads among pagans is of
  greater antiquity than their Christian use, but there is no evidence to
  show that the latter is derived from the former. Glass beads are now the
  most common sort; they form a considerable item in the African
  trade.&mdash;In architecture and joinery the bead is a small round
  moulding. It is of frequent occurrence in architecture, particularly in
  the classical styles, and is used in picture-frames and other objects
  carved in wood.&mdash;<i>St. Cuthbert's Beads</i>, the popular name of
  the detached and perforated joints of encrinites.</p>

  <p><b>Beadle</b> (b&#x113;´dl), an officer in a university, whose chief
  business is to walk with a mace in a public procession: also, a parish
  officer whose business is to punish petty offenders, and a church officer
  (chiefly, although not exclusively, in Scotland) with various subordinate
  duties, as waiting on the clergyman, keeping order in church, attending
  meetings of vestry or session, &amp;c. The primary meaning of the word
  (from O.E. <i>beodan</i>, to offer, announce) appears to be 'herald', one
  who announces or proclaims something. <!-- Page 437 --><span

  <p><b>Bead-snake</b> (<i>Elaps fulvus</i>), a beautiful snake of North
  America, inhabiting cultivated grounds, especially plantations of the
  sweet-potato, and burrowing in the ground. It is finely marked with
  yellow, carmine, and black. Though it possesses poison-fangs it never
  seems to use them.</p>

  <p><b>Beagle</b> (b&#x113;´gl), a small hound, resembling a foxhound or
  harrier, and used to hunt rabbits and hares, being often kept in packs.
  The beagle is smaller than the harrier, compactly built, smooth-haired,
  and with pendulous ears. The smallest of them are little larger than the
  lap-dog.</p>

  <p><b>Beale</b>, Lionel Smith, English physician and biologist, born in
  1828, died in 1906. He was educated at King's College School and King's
  College, London, and was a professor in the medical department of the
  latter institution for forty-three years, finally holding the chair of
  the principles and practice of medicine. His numerous published works
  treat of medical, anatomical, physiological, and biological subjects; the
  microscope; various questions of morality, &amp;c. They include <i>How to
  Work with the Microscope</i>, <i>The Structure of the Tissues</i>,
  <i>Protoplasm</i>, <i>Disease Germs</i>, <i>Life Theories and Religious
  Thought</i>, <i>The Mystery of Life</i>, <i>Bioplasm</i>, <i>On Slight

  <p><b>Beam</b>, a long, straight, and strong piece of wood, iron, or
  steel, especially when holding an important place in some structure, and
  serving for support or consolidation; often equivalent to <i>girder</i>.
  In a balance it is the part from the ends of which the scales are
  suspended. In a loom it is a cylindrical piece of wood on which weavers
  wind the warp before weaving; also, the cylinder on which the cloth is
  rolled as it is woven. In a ship, one of the strong transverse pieces
  stretching across from one side to the other to support the decks and
  retain the sides at their proper distance: hence a ship is said to be 'on
  her beam ends' when lying over on her side. For calculations relating to
  beams, see Morley's <i>Strength of Materials</i> and <i>Theory of
  Structures</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Beam Tree</b> (<i>Pyrus aria</i>), a tree of the same genus as the
  apple, mountain-ash, and service tree found throughout Britain, having
  berries that are edible when quite mellow, and yielding a hard and
  fine-grained wood.</p>

  <p><b>Bean</b>, a name given to several kinds of leguminous seeds and the
  plants producing them, probably originally belonging to Asia. They belong
  to several genera, particularly to Vicia, garden and field bean;
  Phase&#x14F;lus, French or kidney bean; and Dolichos, tropical bean. The
  common bean (<i>Vicia Faba</i>) is cultivated both in fields and gardens
  as food for man and beast. Beans were believed by some of the ancients to
  contain the souls of their ancestors, and Pythagoras would not eat beans
  for this reason. One of the bean family still retains the name of the
  Pythagorean bean. Beans were introduced by the Moors into Spain, whence
  they came to France and later to England. It is possible, however, that
  they were brought to Britain by the Romans. They are now largely imported
  from Egypt, Turkey, Greece, and the Netherlands. There are many
  varieties, as the Mazagan, the Windsor, the long-pod, &amp;c., in
  gardens, and the horse or tick bean in fields. The soil that best suits
  is a good strong clay. The seed of the Windsor is fully an inch in
  diameter; the horse bean is much less, often not much more than half an
  inch in length and three-eighths of an inch in diameter. Beans are very
  nutritious, containing nearly 50 per cent of digestible carbohydrate and
  25 per cent of nitrogenous matter. The bean is an annual, from 2 to 4
  feet high. The flowers are beautiful and fragrant. The <i>kidney
  bean</i>, <i>French bean</i>, or <i>haricot</i> is the <i>Phase&#x14F;lus
  vulg&#x101;ris</i>, a well-known culinary vegetable. There are two
  principal varieties, annual dwarfs and runners. The beans cultivated in
  America and largely used as articles of food belong to the genus
  Phase&#x14F;lus. The <i>scarlet-runner bean</i> (<i>Phase&#x14F;lus
  multiflorus</i>), a native of Mexico, is cultivated on account of its
  long rough pods and its scarlet flowers.</p>

  <p><b>Bean-goose</b> (<i>Anser seg&#x115;tum</i>), a species of wild
  goose, a migratory bird which arrives in Britain in autumn and retires to
  the north in the end of April, though some few remain to breed. Being
  rather less in size than the common wild goose, it is sometimes called
  the <i>small grey goose</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Bean-king</b>, the person chosen king in Twelfth Night festivities
  in virtue of having got the piece of cake containing the bean buried in

    The Polar or White Bear (<i>Ursus mar&#x12D;timus</i>)
  </div>

  <p><b>Bear</b>, the name of several large plantigrade carnivorous mammals
  of the genus Ursus. The teeth are forty-two in number, as in the dog, but
  there is no carnassial or sectorial tooth, <!-- Page 438 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page438"></a>[438]</span>and the molars have a
  more tubercular character than in other carnivores. The eyes have a
  nictitating membrane, the nose is prominent and mobile, and the tail very
  short. The true bears are about ten in number, natives chiefly of Europe,
  Asia, and N. America. They generally lie dormant in their den during the
  winter months. The brown or black bear of Europe is the <i>Ursus
  arctos</i>. It is a native of almost all the northern parts of Europe and
  Asia, and was at one time common in the British Islands. It feeds on
  fruits, roots, honey, ants, and, in case of need, on mammals. It
  sometimes reaches the length of 7 feet, the largest specimens being found
  farthest to the north. It lives solitarily. The American black bear is
  the <i>U. americ&#x101;nus</i>, with black shining fur, and rarely above
  5 feet in length. It is a great climber, is less dangerous than the brown
  bear, and is hunted for its fur and flesh. It is very amusing in
  captivity. The grizzly bear (<i>U. ferox</i> or <i>horribilis</i>) is an
  inhabitant of the Rocky Mountains; it is a ferocious animal, sometimes 9
  feet in length, and has a bulky and unwieldy form, but is nevertheless
  capable of great rapidity of motion. The extinct cave-bear (<i>U.
  spelæus</i>) seems to have been closely akin to the grizzly. The Siberian
  bear (<i>U. coll&#x101;ris</i>) is perhaps a variety of the brown bear.
  The polar or white bear (<i>U. marit&#x12D;mus</i>) is an animal
  possessed of great strength and fierceness. It lives in the polar
  regions, frequents the sea, feeds on fish, seals, &amp;c., and usually is
  7 to 8 feet in length. The Malayan or coco-nut palm bear (<i>U.
  malay&#x101;nus</i>) inhabits Cochin-China, Nepaul, the Sunda Islands,
  &amp;c., lives exclusively on vegetable food, and is an expert climber.
  It is called also sun-bear and bruang. The Indian black bear or
  sloth-bear of India and Ceylon (<i>U. labi&#x101;tus</i>) is reputed to
  be a fierce and dangerous animal.</p>

  <p><b>Bear</b>, or <b>Bere</b>, a species of barley (<i>Hord&#x115;um

    The Constellation of the Great Bear. The two stars on the right are the
    Pointers
  </div>

  <p><b>Bear, Great</b> and <b>Little</b>, the popular names of two
  constellations in the northern hemisphere. The Great Bear (<i>Ursa
  Major</i>) is situated near the pole. It is remarkable for its well-known
  seven stars, by two of which, called the Pointers, the pole-star is
  always readily found. These seven stars are popularly called the
  <i>Wagon</i>, <i>Charles's Wain</i>, or the <i>Plough</i>. The Little
  Bear (<i>Ursa Minor</i>) is the constellation which contains the
  pole-star. This constellation has seven stars placed together in a manner
  resembling those in the Great Bear.</p>

  <p><b>Bear-baiting</b>, the sport of baiting bears with dogs, formerly
  one of the established amusements, not only of the common people, but of
  the nobility and even royalty itself. The places where bears were

  <p><b>Bearberry</b> (<i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i>), an evergreen shrub
  of the heath family growing on the barren moors of Scotland, Northern
  Europe, Siberia, and N. America. The leaves, under the name of <i>uva
  ursi</i>, are used in medicine as an astringent and tonic.</p>

  <p><b>Beard</b>, the hair round the chin, on the cheeks, and the upper
  lip, which is a distinction of the male sex and of manhood. It differs
  from the hair on the head by its greater hardness and its form. Some
  nations have hardly any, others a <!-- Page 439 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page439"></a>[439]</span>great profusion. The
  latter generally consider it as a great ornament; the former pluck it
  out; as, for instance, the American Indians. The beard has often been
  considered as a mark of the sage and the priest. Moses forbade the Jews
  to shave their beards. With the ancient Germans the cutting off another's
  beard was a high offence. Even now the beard is regarded as a mark of
  great dignity among many nations in the East, as the Turks. Alexander the
  Great introduced shaving among the Greeks, by ordering his soldiers to
  wear no beards; among the Romans it was introduced in 296 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> The custom of shaving came into use in modern
  times during the reigns of Louis XIII and XIV of France, both of whom
  ascended the throne without a beard. Till then fashion sanctioned divers
  forms of moustaches and beards. In the reign of Henry VIII of England,
  the authorities of Lincoln's Inn prohibited wearers of beards from
  sitting at the great table unless they paid double commons. Taxation of
  beards was introduced in the reign of Elizabeth, beards of above a
  fortnight's growth being subject to a yearly tax of 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
  This impost was copied by Peter the Great in Russia. It is only in
  comparatively recent times that beards and moustaches have again become
  common.&mdash;Cf. Philippe, <i>Histoire philosophique, politique, et
  religieuse de la barbe</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Beardsley</b>, Aubrey Vincent, artist in black and white, born
  1872, died 1898; took up art as a profession at the age of nineteen, and
  executed a large number of drawings for books and periodicals, showing
  great technical skill, originality, and disregard of conventionality,
  with sometimes a tendency towards the repulsive or morbid. Consumption
  had marked him as its victim from the first. Collections of his drawings
  were published under the titles <i>A Book of Fifty Drawings</i>, <i>The
  Early Work of Aubrey Beardsley</i>, <i>The Late Work of Aubrey
  Beardsley</i>, &amp;c. <i>Under the Hill</i>, with his letters and poems,

  <p><b>Beatification</b>, in the Roman Catholic Church, an act by which
  the Pope declares a person beatified or blessed after his death. It is
  the first step to canonization, that is, the raising one to the honour
  and dignity of a saint. No person can be beatified till fifty years after
  his or her death. All certificates or attestations of virtues and
  miracles, the necessary qualifications for saintship, are examined by the
  Congregation of Rites. This examination often continues for several
  years; after which his Holiness decrees the beatification, and the corpse
  and relics of the future saint are exposed to the veneration of all good
  Christians. The present <!-- Page 440 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page440"></a>[440]</span>custom dates from a Bull of Urban VIII in
  1634, although local veneration may be traced back to the earliest
  Christian ages.&mdash;In the Orthodox Eastern Church beatification is not
  distinguished from canonization.</p>

  <p><b>Beating the Bounds</b>, the periodical survey or perambulation by
  which the boundaries of parishes in England are preserved. It was the
  custom in some places that the clergyman of the parish, with the
  parochial officers and the boys of the parish school, should march to the
  boundaries, where the boys were struck with willow rods. A similar
  ceremony in Scotland was called <i>riding the marches</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Bea´ton</b>, David, Archbishop of St. Andrews, and cardinal, born
  1494. Pope Paul III raised him to the rank of cardinal in Dec., 1538. On
  the death of his uncle, Archbishop James Beaton, he succeeded him in the
  see of St. Andrews in 1539. After the accession of Mary he became
  Chancellor of Scotland, and distinguished himself by his zeal in
  persecuting members of the Reformed party, among the rest the famous
  Protestant preacher George Wishart, whose sufferings at the stake he
  viewed from his window with apparent exultation. At length a conspiracy
  was formed against him, and he was assassinated at his own castle of St.
  Andrews, on the 29th May, 1546. His private character was marked by
  pride, cruelty, and licentiousness.</p>

  died 1290; the daughter of a wealthy citizen of Florence, and wife of
  Simone de Bardi. She was but eight years of age, and Dante nine, when he
  met her first at the house of her father. He altogether saw her only once
  or twice, and she probably knew little of him. The story of his love is
  recounted in the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, which was mostly written after her

  <p><b>Beattie</b> (b&#x113;´ti), James, a Scottish poet and philosophical
  writer, born at Laurencekirk, Kincardineshire, in 1735, died at Aberdeen
  1803. He studied at Marischal College, Aberdeen, for four years, and
  received the <span class="scac">M.A.</span> degree. In 1753 he was
  appointed schoolmaster at Fordoun, a few miles from his native place;
  from whence he obtained a mastership in the Grammar School of Aberdeen,
  and ultimately was installed professor of moral philosophy and logic in
  Marischal College. In 1760 he published a volume of poems, which he
  subsequently endeavoured to buy up, considering them unworthy of him. In
  1765 he published a poem, <i>The Judgment of Paris</i>, and in 1770 his
  celebrated <i>Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth</i>,
  attacking Helvetius and Hume and advocating what was afterwards called
  the doctrine of Common Sense, for which the University of Oxford
  conferred on him the degree of <span class="scac">D.C.L.</span>, and
  George III honoured him, when on a visit to London, with a private
  conference and a pension. He next published in 1771 the first book of his
  poem <i>The Minstrel</i>, and in 1774 the second; this is the only work
  by which he is now remembered. In 1776 he published dissertations on
  <i>Poetry and Music</i>, <i>Laughter and Ludicrous Composition</i>,
  &amp;c.; in 1783 <i>Dissertations, Moral and Critical</i>; in 1786

  <p><b>Beatty</b>, Admiral of the Fleet, Earl, born in 1871. He entered
  the navy in 1884, became Commander in 1898, Rear-Admiral in 1910, and
  Vice-Admiral in 1915. He served in the Sudan from 1896 to 1897, and in
  China in 1900. In 1912 he was Naval Secretary to the First Lord of the
  Admiralty, and from 1912 to 1916 commanded the First Battle Cruiser
  Squadron. He distinguished himself in the battle of Jutland in 1916, and
  until 1919, when he succeeded Admiral Sir Rosslyn Wemyss (now Lord Wester
  Wemyss) as First Sea Lord, he was in command of the Grand Fleet. When the
  entire German High Seas Fleet left port on 31st May, 1916, and steamed up
  the west coast of Denmark, it was quickly sighted by the British scouts,
  so that the main British fleet immediately steamed out from its base to
  engage the enemy. The British Battle Cruiser Squadron, under the command
  of Earl Beatty (then Sir David) was nearer the scene than the main battle
  fleet under Sir John Jellicoe (Viscount Jellicoe of Scapa since 1918).
  The admiral sighted the enemy fleet north-west of the Horn Reef, and
  about 3.30 in the afternoon the ships engaged. The Jutland battle lasted
  only a few hours. At the end of Nov., 1916, Admiral Sir John Jellicoe was
  made First Sea Lord of the Admiralty, and Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty
  took over the supreme command of the Grand Fleet.</p>

  French Revolution he was chosen a member of the National Assembly, of
  which he was for some time president. In 1792 he was general of the army
  of the Rhine. He was falsely accused of having promoted the surrender of
  Mainz, and was sentenced to death 23rd July, 1794.</p>

  <p><b>Beauharnais</b>, Eugène de, Duke of Leuchtenberg, Prince of
  Eichstädt, and Viceroy of Italy during the reign of Napoleon, was born
  1781, died at Munich 1824. He was the son of Alexandre Beauharnais and
  Joséphine, afterwards wife of Napoleon and Empress of France. After his
  father's death he joined Hoche in La Vendée, and subsequently studied for
  a time in Paris. He accompanied Napoleon to Egypt in 1798, rose rapidly
  in the army, was appointed Viceroy of Italy in 1805, and married a
  daughter of the King of Bavaria in 1806. He administered the government
  of Italy with great prudence and moderation, and was much beloved by his
  subjects. In the Russian campaign he commanded the third <i>corps
  d'armée</i>, and greatly distinguished himself. To him and to Ney France
  was mainly indebted for the preservation of the remains of her army
  during the retreat from Moscow. After the battle of Lützen of 2nd May,
  1813, where, by surrounding the right wing of the enemy, he decided the
  fate of the day, he went to Italy, which he defended against the
  Austrians until the deposition of Napoleon. After the fall of Napoleon he
  concluded an armistice, by which he delivered Lombardy and all Upper
  Italy to the Austrians. He then went immediately to Paris, and thence to
  his father-in-law at Munich, where he afterwards resided.&mdash;His
  sister, Hortense Eugénie, Queen of Holland, was born in 1783, died in
  1837. She became Queen of Holland by marrying Louis Bonaparte, and after
  Louis's abdication of the throne she lived apart from him. She wrote
  several excellent songs, and composed some deservedly popular airs, among
  others the well-known <i>Partant pour la Syrie</i>. Napoleon III was her

  <p><b>Beaumarchais</b> (b&#x14D;-mär-sh&#x101;), Pierre Augustin Caron
  de, a French wit and dramatist, was born at Paris in 1732, died 1799. He
  was the son of a watchmaker named Caron, whose trade he practised for a
  time. He early gave striking proofs of his mechanical and also of his
  musical talents; attained proficiency as a player on the guitar and harp,
  and was appointed harp-master to the daughters of Louis XV. By a rich
  marriage (after which he added 'de Beaumarchais' to his name) he laid the
  foundation of the immense wealth which he afterwards accumulated by his
  speculations, and which was also increased by a second marriage. In the
  meantime he occupied himself with literature, and published two
  dramas&mdash;<i>Eugénie</i> in 1767 and <i>Les Deux Amis</i> in 1770. He
  first really distinguished himself by his <i>Mémoires</i> (Paris, 1774),
  or statements in connection with a lawsuit, which by their wit, satire,
  and liveliness entertained all France. The <i>Barber of Seville</i>
  (1775) and the <i>Marriage of Figaro</i> (1784) have given him a
  permanent reputation. His last work was <i>Mes Six Époques</i>, in which
  he <!-- Page 442 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  exposed in the revolution. He lost about a million livres by his edition
  of the works of Voltaire (1785), and still more at the end of 1792 by his
  attempt to provide the French army with 60,000 muskets. He was a singular
  instance of versatility of talent, being at once an artist, politician,
  projector, merchant, and dramatist.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Beaumont</b> (b&#x14D;´mont), Francis, and <b>Fletcher</b>, John,
  two eminent English dramatic writers, contemporaries of Shakespeare, and
  the most famous of literary partners. The former, son of a common-pleas
  judge, was born at Grace-Dieu, in Leicestershire, in 1584, died in 1616,
  and was buried in Westminster Abbey. At the age of sixteen he published a
  translation, in verse, of Ovid's <i>Fable of Salmacis and
  Hermaphroditus</i>, and before nineteen became the friend of Ben Jonson.
  With Fletcher also he was early on terms of friendship. He married
  Ursula, daughter of Henry Isley of Sundridge, in Kent, by whom he left
  two daughters.&mdash;<i>John Fletcher</i> was born at Rye, Sussex, in
  1579. His father was successively Dean of Peterborough, Bishop of
  Bristol, Worcester, and London. <i>The Woman Hater</i>, produced in
  1606-7, is the earliest work known to exist in which he had a hand. It
  does not appear that he was ever married. He died in London of the
  plague, Aug., 1625, and was buried at St. Saviour's, Southwark. The
  friendship of Beaumont and Fletcher, like their literary partnership, was
  singularly close; they lived in the same house, and are said to have even
  had their clothes in common. The works that pass under their names
  consist of over fifty plays, a masque, and some minor poems. It is
  believed that all the minor poems except one were written by Beaumont.
  After the death of Beaumont, Fletcher continued to write plays alone or
  with other dramatists. It is now difficult, if not indeed impossible, to
  determine with certainty the respective shares of the two poets in the
  plays passing under their names. According to the testimony of some of
  their contemporaries, Beaumont possessed the deeper and more thoughtful
  genius, Fletcher the gayer and more idyllic. <i>Four Plays in One</i>,
  <i>Wit at Several Weapons</i>, <i>Thierry and Theodoret</i>, <i>Maid's

  1685. In 1694 he became minister to French Protestants at Berlin. He
  enjoyed much of the favour both of Frederick William I and of the Crown

  some fine edifices, the choir of the uncompleted cathedral being one of
  the finest specimens of Gothic architecture in France. In 1472 Beauvais
  resisted an army of 80,000 Burgundians under Charles the Bold. On this
  occasion the women particularly distinguished themselves, and one of
  them, Jeanne Lainé, called La Hachette, seeing a soldier planting a
  standard on the wall, seized it and hurled him to the ground. The banner

    Beavers (<i>Castor fiber</i>)
  </div>

  <p><b>Beaver</b>, the largest rodent quadruped now existing in the
  northern hemisphere, about 2 feet in length exclusive of the tail, genus
  Castor (<i>C. fiber</i>), is now found in considerable numbers only in
  North America, living in colonies, but occurring solitary in Central
  Europe and Asia. It has short ears, a blunt nose, small fore-feet, large
  webbed hind-feet, with a flat ovate tail covered with scales on its upper
  surface. It is valued for its fur, which used to be largely employed in
  the manufacture of hats, but for which silk is now for the most part
  substituted, and for an odoriferous secretion named castor, at one time
  in high repute, and still largely used in some parts of the world as an
  antispasmodic medicine. The food of the beaver consists of the bark of
  trees, leaves, roots, and berries. Their favourite haunts are rivers and
  lakes which are bordered by forests. In winter they live in houses, which
  are 3 to 4 feet high, are built on the water's edge, and, being
  substantial structures with the entrance under water, afford them
  protection from wolves and other wild animals. These dwellings are called
  beaver 'lodges', and accommodate a single family. They also live in
  burrows. They can gnaw through large trees with their strong teeth, this
  being done partly to obtain food, partly to get materials for houses or
  dam-building. When they find a stream not sufficiently deep for their
  purpose, they throw across it a dam constructed with great ingenuity of
  wood, stones, and mud. Beavers were fairly numerous in Britain in very
  early times, at least in Scotland and Wales. Their existence has been
  recorded in Wales till the thirteenth century, and in Scotland to a later
  date, but they are now extinct in Britain. A colony was some years ago
  introduced into the Island of Bute, but they died out again.&mdash;<span

  was prominent until his death. He opposed the leadership of Prussia in
  Germany and the establishment of the empire, and showed himself
  favourable to the Paris Commune and the International. Found guilty of
  treasonable practices, he was condemned to two years' imprisonment in a

  tribal sections. They live chiefly by husbandry and cattle-rearing, and
  they work with some skill in iron, copper, ivory, and skins. They were
  led to seek British protection owing to the encroachments of the Boers.
  The southern portion of their territory was first placed under British
  protection in 1885, and subsequently the whole Bechuana country up to the
  Zambezi was annexed. In 1895 the <!-- Page 445 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page445"></a>[445]</span>southern portion (then
  a Crown colony) was united to the Cape Colony; the remainder is still a
  protectorate partly under native chiefs. The head-quarters of the British
  administration are at Mafeking in the Cape Province. Bechuanaland
  Protectorate comprises the territory lying between the Molopo River on
  the south and the Zambezi on the north, and extending from the Transvaal
  Province and Matabeleland on the east to South-West Africa; area, 275,000
  sq. miles; pop. 125,350, of whom about 1700 are Europeans. It is
  generally flat or slightly undulating, and is essentially a grass
  country, the grasses being nutritious and standing drought well. Surface
  water is scarce, but there is underground water, besides swampy lakes
  such as Ngami. Some parts are wooded and well watered. Gold, coal, and
  copper have been found. There is railway connection both with south and
  north.&mdash;Cf. G.&nbsp;W. Stow, <i>The Native Races of South Africa</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Beck Case, The</b>, a celebrated case of mistaken identity, which
  involved a grave miscarriage of justice. Adolf Beck, a Swede, had been
  sentenced in 1890 to seven years' penal servitude for a series of mean
  frauds committed against some women, and in 1904 he was again convicted
  and sentenced for a similar offence. Soon after his second trial a Jew
  named John Smith, who had been convicted of fraudulency in 1877, was
  arrested for similar frauds committed while Beck was in custody. The
  resemblance between the two men was remarkable, and it was eventually
  discovered that Beck was entirely innocent. He received two King's
  pardons, and the sum of £5000 from the Home Office as compensation. A
  commission which considered the case drew attention in its report to the
  carelessness of the police in identifying Beck with Smith, though the
  latter was a Jew; and stated that further legal training was desirable
  for the subordinate officials in the Home Office. Beck died in poverty in
  1909. Cf. J. Kempster, <i>Perversion of Justice as exhibited in the Beck

  <p><b>Beck´et</b>, Thomas (the form À Becket is also common), Archbishop
  of Canterbury, born in London 1117 or 1119, assassinated in Canterbury
  Cathedral, 29th Dec., 1170. He was educated at Oxford and Paris, and was
  sent, by the favour of Theobald, Archbishop of Canterbury, to study civil
  law at Bologna in Italy, and on his return made Archdeacon of Canterbury
  and Provost of Beverley. In 1158 Henry II appointed him High Chancellor
  and preceptor to his son, Prince Henry&mdash;the first instance after the
  Conquest of a high office being filled by a native Englishman. At this
  period he was a complete courtier, conforming in every respect to the
  humour of the king. He was, in fact, the king's prime companion, held
  splendid levees, and courted popular applause. On the death of Theobald,
  1162, he was consecrated archbishop, when he affected an extraordinary
  austerity of character, and appeared as a zealous champion of the Church
  against the aggressions of the king, whose policy was to have the clergy
  in subordination to the civil power. Becket was forced to assent to the
  Constitutions of Clarendon, but a series of bitter conflicts with the
  king followed, ending in Becket's flight to France, when he appealed to
  the Pope, by whom he was supported. After much negotiation a sort of
  reconciliation took place in 1170, and Becket returned to England,
  resumed his office, and renewed his defiance of the royal authority. A
  rash hint from the king induced four barons, Reginald Fitz-Urse, William
  de Tracy, Hugh de Morville, and Richard Breto, to go to Canterbury and
  murder the archbishop while at vespers in the cathedral. He was canonized
  in 1172 by Pope Alexander III, and the splendid shrine erected at
  Canterbury for his remains was, for three centuries, a favourite place of
  pilgrimage.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: J.&nbsp;C. Robertson

  <p><b>Beck´ford</b>, William, an English writer famous in his time for
  his immense wealth and his eccentricities. He was born at Fonthill, his
  father's estate in Wiltshire, in 1759. In 1770 the death of his father
  left him in the possession of £1,000,000 of money, and an income of
  £100,000 a year. He travelled much, and for some time lived in Portugal.
  He expended an enormous sum in building and rebuilding Fonthill Abbey,
  near Salisbury, which he filled with rare and expensive works of art.
  Here he lived in seclusion for twenty years. In 1822 the abbey and
  greater part of its contents were sold, and he retired to Bath, where,
  with a much-diminished fortune, but one amply sufficient, he <!-- Page
  446 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page446"></a>[446]</span>lived till
  1844. His literary fame rests upon his Eastern tale <i>The History of the
  Caliph Vathek</i>, which he wrote in French, and a translation of which
  by the Rev. Samuel Henley appeared at London in 1786. The tale is still
  much read, and was highly commended by Lord Byron. He had two daughters,
  one of whom became Duchess of Hamilton, and brought his valuable library
  to this family.&mdash;<i>William Beckford</i>, his father, a London

  <p><b>Becquerel</b> (bek-rel), Antoine César, French physicist, born
  1788, died 1878. He served as an officer of engineers, and retired in
  1815, after which he devoted himself to the study of electricity,
  especially electro-chemistry. In 1837 he was awarded the Copley medal of
  the Royal Society of London. He refuted the 'theory of contact' by which
  Volta explained the action of his pile or battery. Becquerel may be
  considered one of the creators of electro-chemistry.&mdash;His son,
  Alexandre Edmond (1820-91), was associated with him in much of his work.
  He was the author of a work <i>La Lumière, ses causes et ses effets</i>

  <p><b>Becquerel Rays</b> (bek-rel), the rays given out by radium and
  other 'radioactive' substances, so named from their discoverer, the
  French physicist, Henri Becquerel (born 1852, died 1908), son of
  Alexandre Edmond Becquerel. They were first detected in 1896, as
  proceeding from uranium salts; and it is only by uranium, thorium,
  radium, and one or two other elements that they are emitted, these bodies
  giving them out spontaneously and without any apparent loss of
  radioactive power or change of any kind. The Becquerel rays are
  invisible, and only known by their effects, which are of various kinds:
  thus, like the Röntgen rays, they blacken a photographic plate, even
  after passing through glass or other intervening substances; they cause a
  number of different substances to give out a fluorescent light, and they
  render air a conductor of electricity. Like the Röntgen rays, they act
  strongly on the human skin. They consist of a mixture of <span

  <p><b>Beddoes</b> (bed´&#x14D;z), Thomas, physician and author, born
  1760; educated at Oxford, London, and Edinburgh. After taking his
  doctor's degree, and visiting Paris, he was appointed professor of
  chemistry at Oxford. There he published some excellent chemical
  treatises, and essays upon such subjects as the calculus, sea-scurvy,
  consumption, catarrh, and fever. His expressed sympathy with the French
  revolutionists led to his retirement from his professorship in 1792, soon
  after which he published his <i>Observations on the Nature of
  Demonstrative <!-- Page 447 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <i>History of Isaac Jenkins</i>. In 1794 he married a sister of Maria
  Edgeworth; and in 1798, with the pecuniary aid of Wedgwood, opened a
  pneumatic institution for curing phthisical and other diseases by
  inhalation of gases. It speedily became an ordinary hospital, but was
  noteworthy as connected with the discovery of the properties of nitrous
  oxide, and as having been superintended by the young Humphry Davy.
  Beddoes' essays <i>On Consumption</i> (1779) and <i>On Fever</i> (1807),
  and his <i>Hygeia</i> (3 vols., 1807) had a high contemporary repute. He

  of Monkwearmouth, County Durham; educated at St. Peter's Monastery,
  Wearmouth; took deacon's orders in his nineteenth year at St. Paul's
  Monastery, Jarrow, and was ordained priest at thirty by John of Beverley,
  Bishop of Hexham. His life was spent in studious seclusion, the chief
  events in it being the production of homilies, hymns, lives of saints,
  commentaries, and works in history, chronology, grammar, &amp;c. He was
  the most learned Englishman of his day, and in some sense the father of
  English history, his most important work being his <i>Historia
  Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum</i> (or <i>Ecclesiastical History of
  England</i>), afterwards translated by King Alfred into Anglo-Saxon.
  Besides his familiarity with Latin, he knew Greek and had some
  acquaintance with Hebrew. Most of his writings were on scriptural and
  ecclesiastical subjects, but he also wrote on chronology, physical
  science, grammar, &amp;c., and had considerable ability in the writing of
  Latin verse. He died in 735, an interesting record of his closing days
  being preserved in a letter by his pupil Cuthbert. His body was after a
  lapse of time removed from Jarrow church to Durham, but of the shrine
  which formerly enclosed them only the Latin inscription remains, ending
  with the verse&mdash;'Hac sunt in fossa Bedæ venerabilis ossa'. On 13th
  Nov., 1899, Leo XIII decreed that the feast of the Venerable Bede should
  be celebrated in the Church on 27th May. An edition of the whole works of
  Bede (12 vols.), with an English translation, was prepared by Dr. Giles
  (1843-4).&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: Gehle. <i>De Bedæ

  1615-27, he became Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, and in 1629 Bishop
  of Kilmore and Ardagh, though he resigned the latter of the united sees
  in 1630. He set himself to reform abuses and promote the spread of
  Protestantism, procured the translation of the Old Testament into Irish,
  and by his tact and wisdom conciliated the adherents of both creeds. He
  underwent a brief imprisonment on the breaking out of the rebellion in

  <p><b>Bed´ford</b>, a municipal and, until 1918, a parliamentary borough,
  England, county town of Bedfordshire, on the Ouse. The chief buildings
  are the law courts, a range of public schools, a large infirmary, county
  jail, &amp;c., and the churches. The town is rich in charities and
  educational institutions, the most prominent being the Bedford Charity,
  embracing grammar and other schools, and richly endowed. There is an
  extensive manufactory of agricultural implements; lace is also made, and
  there is a good trade. John Bunyan was born at Elstow, a village near the
  town, and it was at Bedford that he lived, preached, and was imprisoned.
  Bedford gives its name to a parliamentary division of the county. Pop.
  40,247.&mdash;<i>Bedfordshire</i> or <i>Beds</i>, the county, is bounded
  by Northampton, Bucks, Herts, Cambridge, and Huntingdon; area, 302,942
  acres, of which 260,000 are under tillage or in permanent pasture. Chalk
  hills, forming a portion of the Chilterns, cross it on the south; north
  of this is a belt of sand; the soil of the vale of Bedford, consisting
  mostly of clay and loam, is very fertile; and the meadows on the Ouse,
  Ivel, and other streams furnish rich pasturage. Two-thirds of the soil is
  under tillage. Besides the usual cereal and other crops, culinary
  vegetables are extensively cultivated for the London market. Principal
  manufactures: agricultural implements, and straw-plait for hats, which is
  made up principally at Dunstable and Luton. The county returns three
  members to Parliament <!-- Page 448 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><b>Bedford</b>, John, Duke of, one of the younger sons of Henry IV,
  King of England; famous as a statesman and a warrior. He defeated the
  French fleet in 1416, commanded an expedition to Scotland in 1417, and
  was lieutenant of England during the absence of Henry V in France. On the
  king's death he became Regent of France, and for several years his policy
  was as successful as it was able and vigorous, the victory of Verneuil in
  1424 attesting his generalship. The greatest stain on his memory is his
  execution of the Maid of Orleans (Joan of Arc) in 1431. He died in 1435
  at Rouen, and was buried in the cathedral of that city.</p>

  <p><b>Bedford Level</b>, a large tract of marshy land in England, of
  about 400,000 acres total area, comprising 63,000 in Norfolk, 30,000 in
  Suffolk, 50,000 in Huntingdon, the Peterborough fen in Northampton, the
  Holland district in Lincolnshire, and most of the Isle of Ely in
  Cambridge. It derives its name from Francis, Earl of Bedford, who in 1634
  made an agreement with Charles I for the drainage of the Level, in
  consideration of receiving 95,000 acres of the reclaimed land. A great
  part of the Level is under cultivation, and produces grain, flax, and
  cole-seed; the remainder yields a winter harvest of wild-fowl for the
  London market. See <i>Fenland</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Bedfordshire Regiment, The</b>, raised in 1688 on the approach of
  the Prince of Orange, suffered severely at Blenheim, and distinguished
  itself in a marked manner at the siege of Lille. In 1797 it went to
  Scotland and there recruited 1000 'parish boys' under sixteen years old,
  who later made excellent soldiers. The regiment shared in the Chitral and
  South African (1900-2) campaigns; on going to the front in 1914,
  sustained heavy losses at Givenchy, and distinguished itself at Ypres and
  the Aisne.</p>

  <p><b>Bed´lam</b>, a corruption of Bethlehem (Hospital), the name of a
  religious house in London, converted, after the general suppression by
  Henry VIII, into a hospital for lunatics. The original Bedlam stood in
  Bishopsgate Street; its modern successor in St. George's Fields was
  opened in 1815, having been built on the site of the notorious tavern
  called 'The Dog and the Duck'. The lunatics were at one time treated as
  little better than wild beasts, and hence Bedlam came to be typical of
  any scene of wild confusion. The average number of patients is about
  300.</p>

  <p><b>Bed´lington</b>, a town and urban district of England, in
  Northumberland, near the mouth of the Blyth, and not far from the seaport
  of Blyth, with collieries, ironworks, &amp;c. Pop. 25,440.</p>

  <p><b>Bedlington Terrier</b>, an English Dog, deriving its name from
  Bedlington, in Northumberland, having first become well known as a
  favourite among the miners of that place. It is a dog of moderate size,
  head rather long, with a light, silky tuft on top, ears hanging close to
  the cheeks, legs moderately long and strong, tail tapering to the point,
  which is almost bare; colour, dark blue, blue and tan, liver, liver and
  tan, sandy, or sandy and tan; courageous, intelligent, and generally
  useful.</p>
